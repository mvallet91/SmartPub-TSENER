      "Finally  , although the SCR-like gene in Leavenworthia shares several features in common with SCR  , including high sequence diversity  , a coding sequence with eight cysteine residues  , and a defensin-like protein predicted to form a compact tertiary structure held together by disulfide bridges  , they align too poorly with those of SCRs to be orthologous. As well  , the Lal2 amino acid sequences have distinct deletions compared with those of Arabidopsis and Brassica SRKs.\n",
      "Second  , discrete cis-regulatory modules could have led to the independent evolution of Angptl4 synthesis in each respective cell type. Previous studies have suggested that the expression and function of defensin genes within the epithelia of the intestine and other exposed tissues has driven rapid evolution of their coding sequences 70  , and our results raise the possibility that similar selective pressures may also affect evolutionary rate of regulatory sequences for angptl4 and potentially other genes.\n",
      "In order to address this issue and ascertain in vivo function  , we aim to use gene targeting and lox/cre MICER Mutagenic Insertion and Chromosome Engineering Resource technology to selectively delete the β-defensin gene clusters in the mouse 16  , 17.

      "While our previous studies indicated the existence of a functional S locus in the SI Leavenworthia races  , the results reported here suggest that the genes comprising the Leavenworthia Lal2/SCRL S locus are unlike those of other Brassicaceae S loci that have been characterized to date. Instead  , the LaLal2 and LaSCRL sequences of Leavenworthia resemble SD-1 receptor kinase and defensin-like gene family members  , respectively  , found in a conserved syntenic block in A. lyrata  , on the same chromosome as the SRK/SCR S locus but distant from it.\n",
      "For the first time  , we show here that β-defensin genes have a profound effect on sperm function in vivo  , and this is manifested in the DefbΔ9/DefbΔ9 mice by increased intracellular calcium  , precocious capacitation and increased spontaneous AR  , which results in microtubule destabilisation  , lack of motility and profound infertility.

Combining the observations that i functional conservation of the intestinal module is restricted to Danio species  , ii transcriptional activity of the intestinal module is sensitive to the microbial status of the intestinal lumen  , and iii this microbial regulation of angptl4 transcript levels is conserved in mammals  , suggests an intriguing possibility that genes expressed in intestinal epithelia exposed to the dynamic and potentially hazardous luminal environment undergo relatively rapid regulatory evolution.\n",

      "Since K+ can freely diffuse from the basolateral fluid of the hair cells to the perilymph in the scala tympani  , it may seem surprising that the K+ concentration was only marginally elevated in the scala tympani of claudin-9 mutant mice. This insulation is likely to be impaired in the nmf329 mice because: 1 the nmf329 mutation eliminated the K+ barrier function of claudin-9  , 2 the timing of hair-cell degeneration in the nmf329 mice coincided with the development of EP  , 3 the OHCs of claudin-9 mutant mice did not degenerate ex vivo under normal culture conditions  , and 4 the OHCs of claudin-9 mutant mice were rescued from degeneration by a second gene defect that reduces the K+-driving force in the cochlea.\n",

      "Claudin 7 is a constitutive component of mammary epithelium at all stages of development  , maintaining a level of gene expression that is approximately proportional to the amount of epithelial tissue in the gland.

      "In addition to claudin-9  , several other claudins have been detected in the junctional complexes of the organ of Corti 34.

In both studies  , labeling decreased thereafter but remained about 10% almost to the end of pregnancy  , consistent with the continued increase in both claudin 7 and keratin mRNA up to day P18.\n",
      "Sukumar and colleagues 5 observed a loss of claudin 7 expression in some human tumors  , particularly lobular tumors. None of these tumors showed ZO1 staining  , indicating that they lacked tight junctions  , so that the claudin 7 observed here was probably associated with membrane vesicles and possibly with basolateral membranes  , as in the normal cells of the mammary gland.\n",
      "Interestingly  , a DNA donor has already been identified with a nonsynonymous SNP id#: rs34769999 in claudin-9 that leads to a non-conservative amino acid substitution in the encoded protein R116C.

      "Of note  , E-cadherin protein expression was negative in both cases of LCIS in which claudin 4 expression was not down regulated. In two of these four invasive lobular carcinomas  , claudin 4 was also underexpressed  , whereas in the other two expression in the invasive lobular carcinoma was at the same level as that seen in normal mammary epithelium.\n",

      "Indeed  , while claudin-low tumors express more GLI1 than the basal  , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 Her2  , and luminal B subtypes overall  , there still existed heterogeneity within this subset Figure 2D. This association fits with our data indicating transcriptional regulation of GLI1 by NFκB  , and speaks to the molecular heterogeneity of the claudin-low subclass.\n",

      "Several SMO antagonists are in clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers 61. An increased molecular understanding of the signaling drivers in EMT and claudin-low cells may not only help patients with claudin-low or mesenchymal-like cancers  , but could also aid in the prevention of metastasis and recurrence in breast cancer patients in general.\n",

Therefore  , the basolateral fluid of hair cells must be insulated from the K+-rich apical milieu.\n",
      "To evaluate the electrophysiological consequences of the claudin-9 mutation in vivo  , we measured the endolymphatic and perilymphatic K+ concentrations  , as well as the EP  , in nmf329/nmf329 mice and control nmf329/+ littermates at P70–P80. These results show that the claudin-9 defect in the nmf329 line does not abolish the endocochlear K+ and voltage gradients.\n",
      "However  , claudin-9 did not cause a change in the dilution potential when measured in the ArgCl buffer Figure 6B.

      "Based on the established activities of Glypicans as positive modulators of BMP signaling and BMP mobility in other systems  , we speculate that this preferential expression of glypican 5 may bias BMP2/4 mobility towards the dorsal side and may increase the ability of BMP2/4 to bind to its receptor.

B The Chordin/BMP2/4 complexes produced on the ventral side of the embryo can nevertheless diffuse towards the dorsal side of the embryo where Tolloid/BMP1 releases free BMP2/4 ligands that  , in the absence of Chordin  , can bind to their receptors and trigger Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and nuclearization.\n",
      "Although it is possible that the absence of GCP6/gpn-1 in T. adhaerens is due to genome incompleteness or a species-specific gene loss  , it is equally plausible that its absence  , along with other glycans T. adhaerens does not produce a distinct ECM 38  , reflects an expansion and diversification of genes involved in production and maintenance of the ECM in eumetazoans.

      "We speculate that the BMP2/4-glypican 5 positive regulatory input we have characterized likely plays a role in intensifying BMP2/4-Alk3/6 interactions in the dorsal ectoderm. Mathematical modeling of BMP signaling during D/V patterning as well as experimental studies in other signaling pathways predict that positive feedback circuits can convert graded inputs into all or no outputs leading to production of bistable signaling states in which there is a sharp transition between cells displaying a high level of signaling and cells with very low signaling 63 ,64.\n",
      "Whereas the autonomous effects on tissue size caused by deregulation of these tumor suppressor pathways are most probably due  , as least in part see below  , to the capacity of Dally to facilitate Dpp spreading throughout the tissue  , we propose that the nonautonomous effects on cell number are a consequence of withdrawal of Dpp from neighboring tissues Fig 8A. We show that the glypican Dally  , which plays a major role in regulating the spread of Dpp in Drosophila tissues 49–52 ,59  , is up-regulated upon deregulation of these tumor suppressor pathways and that the increase in Dally expression levels contributes to the autonomous effects on tissue size and to the nonautonomous reduction in cell number.\n",

PCV development takes place in a complex and changing extracellular environment  , but while there is some evidence that PCV-specific BMP signaling can be influenced by changes in tissue morphology 18 or loss of the cell-bound glypican heparan sulfate proteoglycans 17  , other aspects of the environment have not been greatly investigated.\n",

This nonautonomous effect is a consequence of a reduction in both cell size and proliferation rates cell number  , and it is not a consequence of programmed cell death or the withdrawal of nutrients from neighboring tissues  , as reducing the levels of proapoptotic genes or subjecting larvae to different amino-acid diets does not have any impact on the size reduction of neighboring cell populations.\n",
