      "The relationships between cystatin M loss and PR loss in DCISs and IBCs were similar to those between cystatin M loss and ER loss  , but HER2 loss was not significantly associated with cystatin M loss in DCISs and IBCs P = 0.73 and P = 0.79  , respectively. Cystatin M loss occurred in 50 68% of 74 ER-negative IBCs and in 49 49% of 101 ER-positive IBCs.\n",
      "However  , the mechanism by which cystatin M expression is regulated by ER  , PR  , and HER4 awaits further elucidation. In addition  , cystatin M loss occurred more frequently in IBCs with the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4 than without  , suggesting that cystatin M expression may be influenced by synergistic effect of those proteins.\n",
      "To investigate the clinicopathological significance of cystatin M loss and to identify possible factors associated with cystatin M loss in breast cancer  , we analyzed the expression status of five proteins ER  , PR  , HER2  , HER4  , and cystatin M and the hypermethylation of CST6 gene in a total of 292 breast cancer patients. Based on these reports  , we hypothesized that cystatin M may be a downstream target of ER and/or HER4 and that CST6 methylation may be influenced by the alteration of ER and/or HER4.\n",
      "In addition  , cystatin M loss occurred more frequently in IBCs with the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4 than without  , suggesting that cystatin M expression may be influenced by synergistic effect of those proteins. In this study  , cystatin M loss occurred in 9 8% of 117 patients with DCIS and in 99 57% of 175 patients with IBC  , supporting previous reports 3 ,4 ,7 that cystatin M is one of many factors that are involved in the acquisition of an invasive cellular phenotype in breast cancer.\n",
      "Accordingly  , additional work in a large number of samples will also be required to precisely determine the role of cystatin M as a prognostic marker and to understand the association of epigenetic modification with cystatin M loss. Furthermore  , patient prognosis according to cystatin M loss was not analyzed due to a short period of follow-up.\n",
      "The association between cystatin M loss and clinicopathological parameters in 117 DCISs and 175 IBCs is shown in Table 1. If the mean score was less than two  , the tumor was considered to exhibit loss of cystatin M expression.\n",
      "A statistically significant association was not found between cystatin M loss and pathologic stage in IBCs P = 0.86. Furthermore  , the histologic grade was not associated with cystatin M loss in DCISs P = 0.90 or IBCs P = 0.32.\n",
      "Furthermore  , exogenous expression of recombinant cystatin M results in the suppression of cell proliferation  , migration  , and matrix invasion in vitro 8. The loss of cystatin M expression is associated with the progression of primary tumors to a metastatic phenotype 3 ,4 ,7.\n",
      "Taken together  , the present study suggests that cystatin M loss in IBC may be associated with triple negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4. Accordingly  , additional work in a large number of samples will also be required to precisely determine the role of cystatin M as a prognostic marker and to understand the association of epigenetic modification with cystatin M loss.\n",
      "B The association between cystatin M loss and triple-negative IBCs was analyzed according to the expression status of HER2. A Cystatin M loss occurred at a higher prevalence in the triple-negative IBCs than in other subtypes P = 0.001.\n",
      "No association was found between cystatin M loss and the number of lymph nodes  , family history of breast cancer in DCISs and IBCs. The mean tumor size was 2.9 cm and 2.6 cm for IBC patients with and without cystatin M loss  , respectively.\n",
      "Cystatin M is known to inhibit the activity of cystein proteases which degrade extracellular matrix components. Based on these observations  , one possibility is that cystatin M may be a downstream target of HER4-ER in IBC and be influenced by PR.\n",
      "Cystatin M is abundantly expressed in normal and premalignant breast epithelium  , but its expression has been reported to be diminished or lost in breast cancers 3-7. Cystatin M is a candidate tumor suppressor that functions as a physiological inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases.\n",

      "The CST6 gene encoding cystatin M contains a large CpG island that spans the proximal promoter and exon 1  , encompassing the transcription start site. Furthermore  , exogenous expression of recombinant cystatin M results in the suppression of cell proliferation  , migration  , and matrix invasion in vitro 8.\n",
      "The age of patients with DCIS or IBC was not significantly different according to cystatin M expression P = 0.13 and P = 0.89  , respectively. Cystatin M loss was found in 9 8% of the 117 DCISs and in 99 56% of 175 IBCs studied P < 0.0001.\n",

      "In univariate logistic regression analysis Table 2A  , cystatin M loss occurred at 2.20 times 95% confidence interval CI = 1.19 to 4.06; P = 0.02 higher prevalence in the ER-negative IBCs than in the ER-positive IBCs. These observations suggest that the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4 may be significantly associated with cystatin M loss in IBCs.\n",
      "These observations suggest that the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4 may be significantly associated with cystatin M loss in IBCs.

      "To rule out the possibility of a confounding effect of HER2 in the relationship between cystatin M loss and the triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4  , we stratified the data according to the expression status of HER2 and reanalyzed the relationship according to HER2. However  , cystatin M loss in IBCs was significantly associated with the triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4 P = 0.001; Figure 2A: cystatin M loss occurred in 20 87% of 23 triple-negative IBCs of ER  , PR  , and HER4 and in 79 52% of 152 other subtypes.\n",

      "Although the interaction of HER4 with PR is not known in breast cancer  , a positive association between HER4 and ER has been reported by many groups. Triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER2 was not associated with cystatin M loss  , but another triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4 was significantly associated with cystatin M loss in IBC  , suggesting a different role of HER4 independently of HER2.\n",

      "Qualitative analysis of . D No relationship was found between CST6 methylation by MSP and the cystatin M loss in DCIS P = 0.38 and IBC P = 0.50.\n",
      "Triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER2 was not associated with cystatin M loss  , but another triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4 was significantly associated with cystatin M loss in IBC  , suggesting a different role of HER4 independently of HER2. The HER2 is well known as a major player in initiation or progression of breast cancer  , but the significance of HER4 in breast cancer has not been studied extensively.\n",
      "The lack of association between cystatin M loss and hypermethylation of the CST6 gene may be due to the density dependence of methylated CpGs on transcriptional silencing by CST6 methylation or the inconsistence of methylation status between primer binding sites and other CpG sites within PCR product. No association was also found between CST6 methylation and cystatin M loss in DCISs P = 0.38 or IBCs P = 0.50 Figure 3D.\n",
      "Relationship between cystatin M loss and the triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4. Triple-negative indicates IBCs with the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4.\n",

      "Tissue microarrays TMAs of DCISs and IBCs were prepared as described previously 15. Representative stainings of ER  , PR  , HER2  , HER4 and cystatin M expression in DCISs and IBCs are shown in Figure 1.\n",
      "However  , no confounding effect of HER2 was found in this study: cystatin M loss occurred at a higher prevalence in the triple-negative IBCs than in other subtypes irrespective of HER2 expression Figure 2B. To rule out the possibility of a confounding effect of HER2 in the relationship between cystatin M loss and the triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4  , we stratified the data according to the expression status of HER2 and reanalyzed the relationship according to HER2.\n",
      "Triple-negative indicates IBCs with the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4. For HER2-positive IBCs  , cystatin M loss was found in 8 89% of 9 triple-negative cases and in 33 51% of 65 other subtypes P = 0.04.\n",
      "Only cytoplasmic reactivity was considered evidence of HER4 as well as cystatin M expression. The membrane or nuclear staining of HER4 was not considered in the final data analysis due to low frequency < 5% of the staining in IBCs.\n",
      "We searched for putative ER target sequences within the promoter of the CST6 by using the motif search program 25. To the best of our knowledge  , cystatin M has not previously been suggested as a downstream target of ER in breast cancer.\n",
      "The association between the quantity of CST6 methylation and the expression statuses of cystatin M  , ER  , PR  , and HER4 in tumor tissues was analyzed Figure 4B. The quantities of methylated CpGs between normal and tumor tissues were usually different Figure 4A.\n",
      "The average quantities of methylated CpGs between groups with and without ER loss were 16.4% and 8.7%  , respectively. Average quantities of methylated CpGs in tumor tissues were significantly associated with cystatin M loss P = 0.008; Wilcoxon rank sum test or ER loss P = 0.0002; Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n",
      "We had access to 129 skeletal muscle biopsies taken at age 70 years in 1992 and we processed these in 2012 with the majority having excellent NUSE plot profiles. Renal function was estimated using cystatin C  , which is a marker of glomerular filtration rate 4.\n",
      "These observations suggest that the effect of ER on cystatin M expression may not be mediated directly through ER-binding to the promoter of the CST6 gene. ER is also known to interact with other transcription factors such as AP-1 and SP-1 26 ,27.\n",
      "Cystatin M is a candidate tumor suppressor that functions as a physiological inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases. Several groups have reported DNA methylation-dependent silencing of CST6 gene in breast cancer cell lines and primary invasive ductal carcinomas  , but the upstream initiators that direct this process have not been elucidated 5 ,6.\n",
      "Cutoff values for positive or negative expression were determined considering widely accepted criteria among previously reported studies and expression patterns in our normal tissues data not shown. If the IS was less than two  , the tumor was considered to exhibit loss of HER4 or cystatin M expression.\n",
      "Heterogenous staining  , defined in our study as when the staining pattern was different among cells within the same block  , is often known to be seen in epigenetically silenced genes within advanced tumors. A statistically significant association was not found between cystatin M loss and pathologic stage in IBCs P = 0.86.\n",
      "Therefore  , we analyzed the association of triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER2 with cystatin M loss. Triple-negative breast cancers TNBCs of ER  , PR  , and HER2  , are known to be typically associated with poor prognosis due to aggressive behavior of the tumor and lack of targeted therapies.\n",
      "When a slide showed heterogeneous staining  , we grouped cells according to staining intensity and calculated the immunoreactive score IS of 0 to 7 for cystatin M expression in each group separately. Heterogeneous staining was found in 4 3% of 117 DCISs and in 6 3% of 175 IBCs.\n",
      "The expression of cystatin F  , α2-macroglobulin  , and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP were also markedly increased. Protease inhibitors were among the most highly upregulated genes; for example  , serpin3An was induced approximately 4  , 14 and 20-fold at 3  , 5 and 8 months in the PPT1 knockout brain.\n",
      "Based on these observations  , one possibility is that cystatin M may be a downstream target of HER4-ER in IBC and be influenced by PR. In addition  , molecules involved in cell adhesion to extracellular matix and cytoskeletal interaction are known to be regulated by induced PR even in the absence of ligand 18 ,19.\n",
      "The negative and positive indicate the presence and absence of expression of each protein  , respectively. B The quantities of methylated CpGs in IBC show a significant association with the cystatin M loss P = 0.008 and ER loss P = 0.0002  , but not with the PR P = 0.64 or HER4 loss P = 0.87.\n",
      "Several groups have reported DNA methylation-dependent silencing of CST6 gene in breast cancer cell lines and primary invasive ductal carcinomas  , but the upstream initiators that direct this process have not been elucidated 5 ,6. The CST6 gene encoding cystatin M contains a large CpG island that spans the proximal promoter and exon 1  , encompassing the transcription start site.\n",
      "The methylation level at each CpG in tumor tissues was adjusted by subtracting the quantity of methylated CpGs in matched normal tissue from that of methylated CpGs in tumor tissue. The association between the quantity of CST6 methylation and the expression statuses of cystatin M  , ER  , PR  , and HER4 in tumor tissues was analyzed Figure 4B.\n",
      "A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between cystatin M loss and any covariates found to be statistically significant in the univariate analysis  , and to calculate odds ratios ORs. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test or t-test and Fisher's exact test or the Chi-squared test were used for the univariate analysis of the continuous and categorical variables  , respectively.\n",
      "Consistent with this  , CST6  , which encodes the cysteine protease inhibitor  , cystatin M  , has been shown to be silenced following DNA methylation of CpG islands located within the promoter region  , but not within exon 1 41. This supports the well established concept that the location of the CpG dinucleotides subjected to methylation plays an important role in determining whether genes are silenced or not.\n",
      "The biological meaning of the cutoff criteria for positive expression that was adopted in this study was not clear  , and poorly justified cutoffs may lead to wrong conclusions and contribute to non-reproducibility of results. Taken together  , the present study suggests that cystatin M loss in IBC may be associated with triple negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4.\n",
      "Global RNA 5–9 and DNA methylation profiling 10–12 have been recently utilized to study the biology of chronological age. For example  , in people with cardiovascular disease  , circulating cystatin C concentration  , a parameter that estimates renal function  , was related to 10-year mortality but was insufficient to predict cardiovascular deaths in healthy older subjects 4.\n",
      "Furthermore  , patient prognosis according to cystatin M loss was not analyzed due to a short period of follow-up. For the quantitative analysis of methylation status in IBC  , this study was severely limited by the small number of fresh-frozen tissues 51 samples which may have led to an incorrect conclusion between ER expression and CST6 methylation.\n",
      "Gene score was also unrelated to resting heart rate or physical activity questionnaire  , and thus habitual exercise status. No relationship between baseline gene score and renal function estimated from cystatin C  , r2 < 0.001  , systolic blood pressure mmHg  , r2 = 0.0013  , 2 h glucose concentration following a standard oral glucose tolerance test OGTT; mmol  , r2 = 0.015 or total cholesterol mmol  , r2 = 0.002 was observed.\n",
      "Covariates with a P-value of <0.25 in the univariate analysis or any variables that were considered to be biologically important were subjected to the multivariate analysis. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between cystatin M loss and any covariates found to be statistically significant in the univariate analysis  , and to calculate odds ratios ORs.\n",
      "Epigenetic silencing of CST6 gene in breast cancer has been reported by several groups. The lack of association between cystatin M loss and hypermethylation of the CST6 gene may be due to the density dependence of methylated CpGs on transcriptional silencing by CST6 methylation or the inconsistence of methylation status between primer binding sites and other CpG sites within PCR product.\n",
      "Average quantities of methylated CpGs in tumor tissues were significantly associated with cystatin M loss P = 0.008; Wilcoxon rank sum test or ER loss P = 0.0002; Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The methylation level at each CpG in tumor tissues was adjusted by subtracting the quantity of methylated CpGs in matched normal tissue from that of methylated CpGs in tumor tissue.\n",
      "Based on these reports  , we hypothesized that cystatin M may be a downstream target of ER and/or HER4 and that CST6 methylation may be influenced by the alteration of ER and/or HER4. 14 reported that ER and HER4 can target estrogen-inducible gene promoters such as stromal cell-derived factor 1 SDF-1  , a putative key player of the matrix remodeling.\n",
      "The resultant network Figure 5 showed that epigenetic changes could be identified at several of these gene loci  , including EGFR  , the lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin M CST6 60 and the transcriptional repressors ZEB2 and SNAI2. Given the marked morphological differences in vitro between these cell lines 39  , we mapped the biological association of 35 focus genes reported to be associated with EMT 40.\n",
      "For example  , in people with cardiovascular disease  , circulating cystatin C concentration  , a parameter that estimates renal function  , was related to 10-year mortality but was insufficient to predict cardiovascular deaths in healthy older subjects 4. So far  , use of individual molecular biomarkers in healthy populations has offered modest performance 1  , 2 compared with traditional  , more integrated disease markers e.g.  , blood pressure or chronological age 3.\n",
      "Triple-negative breast cancers TNBCs of ER  , PR  , and HER2  , are known to be typically associated with poor prognosis due to aggressive behavior of the tumor and lack of targeted therapies.

Disease-associated  , mutant misfolded proteins such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 1  , peripheral myelin protein 22 2  , huntingtin Htt 3  , parkin 4  , α-synuclein 5 ,6  , ataxin-3  , and Down syndrome critical region 1 7 are found to accumulate in aggresomes.\n",
      "Similar results were found in skin tissues unpublished data. This indicates that in both patients aged 87 y and 64 y at time of death  , intestinal stem cells that were supposed to have accumulated mutant ataxin-3 over the course of patients' entire lives were devoid of large aggregates  , whereas the short-lived committed and differentiated cells did contain such polyglutamine aggregates.\n",
      "We sequence the top candidate regions  , 5.8 Mb in total  , and find that four genes  , all with synaptic function  , are enriched for case-specific variants: neuronal-cadherin CDH2  , catenin alpha2 CTNNA2  , ataxin-1 ATXN1  , and plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase PGCP. These regions are enriched for genes involved in synapse formation and function  , as are regions with patterns of reduced variation consistent with artificial selection.\n",
      "These combined results suggest that TARDBP plays a pivotal role in the pathogenic pathways leading to motor neuron degeneration culminating in ALS.

      "Although intestinal dysfunction is not obvious in patients with SCA3  , this tissue provides an elegant model to investigate the tissue distribution of accumulated mutant ataxin-3 polyglutamine protein during the individual's lifespan.

This asymmetric inheritance appears to be evolutionarily conserved and occurs with a stringent polarity in progenitor cells  , preventing transmission of damaged proteins to the longest lived daughter cell.\n",
      "Most of these interactors are mutated in other neurodegenerative disorders  , such as dementia and expanded polyglutamine repeat disorders  , whereas some may participate in generalized processes such as autophagy. Interestingly  , a number of in vivo studies have demonstrated that TARDBP has a number of genetic interactors such as Ataxin-2 46  , progranulin GRN 48  , 67–69  , valosin-containing protein VCP 70  , 71 and histone deacetylase 6 HDAC6 36  , 38.\n",
      "Further evidence for a determined assembly order of SGs comes from the observation that in budding yeast cells upon mild heat shock  , translation factors form foci at sites where SGs will later form when the temperature is raised further 26. Thus  , SGs can form after azide treatment independently of PB formation ability or of the mRNA-binding proteins Pbp1 Ataxin-2 homolog and Pub1 TIA-1 homolog  , but not after glucose deprivation 25.\n",

      "Because double staining with the Musashi-1 antibody and the anti-polyglutamine or anti–ataxin-3 antibody was not possible  , we identified putative stem cells in the crypts on the basis of their localisation next to the Paneth cells. In agreement with earlier data 21–23  , the Musashi-1 antibody indeed decorated cells adjacent to or in between the Paneth cells Figure 4B and 4C  , further supporting the idea that these are the stem cells within the intestinal epithelium.\n",

In fact  , the percentage of non–stem cells with aggregates in the crypts of both patients was strikingly high  , whereas stem cells containing aggregates were never detected Figure 4K.\n",
      "As deletion of the 3′ region in the α-SCA7-92R transgenic mice significantly stabilized the CAG-92 tract 13  , we hypothesized that cis-elements within this 3′ region modify repeat instability at the SCA7 locus. To localize the cis-acting elements responsible for this instability tendency  , we derived lines of transgenic mice based upon the original 13.5 kb ataxin-7 genomic fragment  , deleting a large region ∼8.3 kb of human sequence beyond the 3′ end of the CAG tract α-SCA7-92R construct.\n",
      "If the principle of asymmetric distribution of damage indeed holds true for proliferating tissues  , it may enable mitotically competent cells to avoid the risk of accumulating toxic protein aggregates during ageing  , or in the case of protein misfolding diseases  , thus preserving the cells' capacity to produce progeny. Although the ataxin-3 protein is known to be ubiquitously expressed 41 and was also detected in stem cells in the intestine Figure 4  , we cannot exclude the possibility that the lack of large aggregates in the stem cells is possibly also due to a lower expression of the protein.\n",

A summary of the repeat and domain organizations of the novel predicted tenascins and the previously described amniote tenascins is shown in Figure 8.\n",
      "In birds and mammals  , tenascin-R genes encode 4.5 EGF-like repeats and 9 FN type III domains. Tenascin-R was the second member of the tenascin family to be identified 13.\n",
      "It can also be hypothesized that the tenascin-W gene was transposed from the original locus on chromosome 19 into its current location soon after the duplication that gave rise to the tenascin-C and tenascin-R genes. Because the chromosome 1 and 9 MHC regions are so well-related as to indicate their origin from the most recent large-scale duplication 44  , the positioning of tenascin-W adjacent to tenascin-R suggests either that: 1 this positioning was ancestral to the duplication event and a tenascin gene has been lost or transposed away from adjacent the tenascin-C gene; or 2 the tenascin-W gene arose by a tandem duplication of tenascin-R after the original duplication event and with a relatively rapid rate of change to the polypeptide sequence.\n",
      "This conserved chromosomal location between chicken tenascin-Y and its neighboring genes and the human  , mouse and T. nigriviridis tenascin-X genes provides the most convincing argument that  , despite distinctions in the polypeptide sequences  , these genes all represent tenascin orthologs. As noted above  , the gene neighbors of T. nigroviridis tenascin-X also correspond to MHC genes.\n",
      "It will be interesting to establish if the persistence of tenascin-C paralogs is specific to the pufferfish lineage. Interestingly  , in the family Tetraodontidae the only tenascin to persist as a duplicated gene is tenascin-C. Searches of the latest zebrafish genome assembly Zv5  , Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute identify only one tenascin-C on chromosome 5 NP_ 570982.\n",
      "No tenascins have been identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome or in arthropod genomes  , and the only complete cDNA sequences from poikilotherms come from D. rerio 17 ,20 ,21. These studies show that the basic domain architecture of tenascins is highly conserved between an invertebrate chordate and vertebrates and that there are only four members of the tenascin family in vertebrates: tenascin-C  , tenascin-R  , tenascin-W and tenascin-X.\n",
      "Like tenascin-C in Gallus gallus and man  , tenascin-Cb contains an RGD integrin-binding motif in its third FN type III domain in a region predicted to be exposed to receptor binding. Because of their sequence similarity to each other and to other tenascin-Cs  , overall domain organization  , and predicted evolutionary proximity  , we will refer to these paralogs as tenascin-Ca modified from GSTENT00020055001 and tenascin-Cb modified from GSTENT00025206001.\n",
      "There is an RGD motif in the fifth FN type III domain of T. rubripes tenascin-W  , but this motif is not found in tenascin-W from Tetraodon nigroviridis. A similar tenascin-W was found in the genome of Takifugu rubripes SINFRUP00000069989  , but this tenascin-W has five FN type III domains instead of four.\n",
      "The T. nigroviridis tenascin-R sequence  , however  , is not complete; the genomic sequence found between the regions encoding the EGF-like repeats and FN type III domains contains approximately 500 undetermined nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis of the FReD and terminal FN type III domain show this potential tenascin to be most similar to amniote and zebrafish tenascin-R. Like tenascin-R in D. rerio it is adjacent to  , and in the opposite orientation from  , a tenascin-W gene see below.\n",
      "We have also identified a tenascin-type FReD domain in O. dioica and expect to identify a full length tenascin when the genomic sequencing is completed and assembled. With only one copy of tenascin  , C. intestinalis may represent an ideal model system for future studies of tenascin function  , since analysis of its knockdown by morpholinos or its misexpression would not be complicated by the possible compensatory action of related tenascin gene products.\n",
      "However  , the most striking evidence that the unusual tenascin-X of T. nigroviridis is indeed a member of this particular tenascin subfamily is its genomic location: it is found on chromosome 8 flanked by the genes encoding cytochrome p450 21-hydroxylase and C4 complement Figure 4C. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the FReDs from the putative pufferfish tenascin-Xs are most similar to the FReDs of chicken tenascin-Y and mammalian tenascin-X see below.\n",
      "Finally  , much of the diversity seen in the size of tenascin-W can be accounted for by the multiple duplications of the exon encoding the third FN type III domain in different species. X. tropicalis tenascin-X shares features with both the smaller teleost tenascin-Xs and the very large tenascin-Xs found in mammals.\n",
      "There are 6 names for tenascin gene products found in the current literature Figure 1. Only characterized in the mouse  , tenascin-N is identical to murine tenascin-W except for three additional FN type III domains i.e.  , a total of 12 domains.\n",
      "All authors read and approved the final manuscript. JCA provided advice on web-based bioinformatics resources  , identified Ciona tenascin and the putative amphioxus tenascin through ESTs  , and contributed extensively to the studies of tenascin synteny and each draft of the text.\n",
      "This tenascin has 18.5 EGF-like repeats  , and the tenascin-X genes of mouse and human encode 29 and 32 FN type III domains  , respectively. Tenascin-X is the name given to a large mammalian tenascin first identified as \"gene X\" in the major histocompatibility complex MHC class III gene region in both mouse and human 14 ,15.\n",
      "JCA provided advice on web-based bioinformatics resources  , identified Ciona tenascin and the putative amphioxus tenascin through ESTs  , and contributed extensively to the studies of tenascin synteny and each draft of the text. JCA and RPT conceived the project.\n",
      "The locus of tenascin-W adjacent to tenascin-R on chromosome 1 is suggestive of a distinct evolutionary origin  , for example by local tandem duplication of an ancestral tenascin gene. Although a fourth paralogous MHC gene cluster is encoded on human chromosome 19p13-1-13.3  , no tenascin is encoded in this region  , suggesting that this paralog was lost after the initial large-scale duplication events 44.\n",
      "This was determined by a BLAT search of the T. rubripes genome with the FReD of Tetraodon nigroviridis tenascin-X. The unusual repeat and domain structure of T. nigroviridis tenascin-X is also seen in Takifugu rubripes tenascin-X.\n",
      "Similarly duplicated tenascin-C genes were identified in the Takifugu rubripes genome Figure 3A. In tenascin-Ca this region contains the potentially reactive motif KGD.\n",
      "Because of their sequence similarity to each other and to other tenascin-Cs  , overall domain organization  , and predicted evolutionary proximity  , we will refer to these paralogs as tenascin-Ca modified from GSTENT00020055001 and tenascin-Cb modified from GSTENT00025206001. Bayesian inference of the phylogenetic trees predicts that these proteins are more closely related to each other than to any other vertebrate tenascin.\n",
      "The unusual repeat and domain structure of T. nigroviridis tenascin-X is also seen in Takifugu rubripes tenascin-X. The middle gene encodes a predicted tenascin with one EGF-like repeat  , 19 charged repeats similar to those found in T. nigroviridis tenascin-X interrupted by two partial charged repeats  , a charged domain that is 69% identical to amino acids 271–572 in T. nigroviridis tenascin-X  , one partial and three complete FN type III domains  , and a C-terminal FReD.\n",
      "The tenascin-X gene in pufferfish encodes previously undescribed  , highly charged repeats. The observation that X. tropicalis tenascin-X contains a region with sequence similar both to UNC-89 as well as bird and human tenascin-X leads us to suggest that this region may have a role that is important to tenascin-X function  , and its biological properties should be studied further.\n",
      "Thus  , although tenascin-X is the most divergent family member in terms of protein sequence  , its gene locus on chromosome 6q21.3 is paralogous with that of the tenascin-C and -R genes 44 ,45. The loci of the tenascin-C and tenascin-R genes are also known to be part of the MHC loci that exist as paralogous regions on chromosomes 1q  , 6p  , 9q and 19p.\n",
      "It was identified by combining two predicted proteins 30377_prot and scaffold_197.67 using the C-terminal sequence of the former  , since this was the most similar to tenascin FReDs following alignment. The fourth tenascin found in the X. tropicalis genome is tenascin-W.\n",
      "The two pufferfish studied here are closely related  , having diverged from a common ancestor only 18–30 million year ago 54. In keeping with the established protocol for naming very similar duplicated genes  , we propose that these tenascin-C paralogs be referred to as tenascin-Ca and tenascin-Cb.\n",
      "There are no tenascins in Caenorhabiditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesize that tenascin-X arose from the first tenascin gene duplication in vertebrates.\n",
      "In tenascin-Ca this region contains the potentially reactive motif KGD. Like tenascin-C in Gallus gallus and man  , tenascin-Cb contains an RGD integrin-binding motif in its third FN type III domain in a region predicted to be exposed to receptor binding.\n",
      "Since tenascin-C and tenascin-W are often co-expressed during development 17 ,18 ,51 it is interesting to speculate that they may have overlapping functions related to their binding to an RGD-dependent integrin. It is intriguing to note that species that lack an RGD motif in the third FN type III domain of tenascin-C i.e.  , X. tropicalis and mouse have an RGD motif in their tenascin-W.\n",
      "Tenascin-R was the second member of the tenascin family to be identified 13. The prominent expression of tenascin-C in tendons and embryonic extracellular matrix was used to create the name for the gene family  , which comes from tenere to hold and nasci to be born; see 12.\n",
      "JCA and RPT conceived the project. RC-E identified and analyzed the Ciona tenascin sequence  , analyzed tenascin-X synteny and contributed to major revisions to the manuscript.\n",
      "The fifth tenascin appears to be the result of a relatively recent duplication of the tenascin-C gene. Analysis of two pufferfish genomes revealed not four  , but five  , tenascins.\n",
      "The series of FN type III domains are interrupted in both mouse and human tenascin-X by a proline-rich stretch of about 100 amino acids. This tenascin has 18.5 EGF-like repeats  , and the tenascin-X genes of mouse and human encode 29 and 32 FN type III domains  , respectively.\n",
      "A putative gene product with a repeat and domain structure similar to zebrafish tenascin-W was identified in T. nigroviridis GSTENT00028391001. There is an RGD motif in the fifth FN type III domain of T. rubripes tenascin-W  , but this motif is not found in tenascin-W from Tetraodon nigroviridis.\n",
      "A previous study in the zebrafish 17 reported five FN type III domains in the cDNA sequence of tenascin-W. Since tenascin-C and tenascin-W are often co-expressed during development 17 ,18 ,51 it is interesting to speculate that they may have overlapping functions related to their binding to an RGD-dependent integrin.\n",
      "Finally  , in C. intestinalis  , the single tenascin gene is adjacent to a Notch gene just like all vertebrate tenascins which are located in close proximity to a Notch gene present in the MHC paralogous regions  , supporting the common ancestry. On present evidence we cannot distinguish between these models  , but it is interesting to note that the tenascin-W protein sequence is equivalently related around 34%-36% to both tenascin-C and tenascin-R.\n",
      "Tenascin-X is the name given to a large mammalian tenascin first identified as \"gene X\" in the major histocompatibility complex MHC class III gene region in both mouse and human 14 ,15. In birds and mammals  , tenascin-R genes encode 4.5 EGF-like repeats and 9 FN type III domains.\n",

      "The COILS program see Methods predicts that it has heptad repeats near the N-terminus underlined in Figure 4A  , and SMART reveals a single tenascin-type EGF-like sequence that  , as in tenascin-Y  , is followed by what may be considered a partial EGF-like repeat. The putative Tetraodon nigroviridis tenascin-X is much smaller than mammalian tenascin-X: it encodes at most 1108 amino acids and is predicted to have a molecular mass of 122 kDa.\n",
      "In the case of mammalian tenascin-C and tenascin-X  , distinct processes of conservative or concerted evolution have been described for their FN type III domains 42. This diversity again points out the potential hazards of giving proteins a new name based on the number of repeated domains – of the four tenascin subfamilies  , only the tenascin-Rs have the same number of FN type III domains encoded in the genes of fish  , birds and mammals.\n",
      "For example  , in Tetraodon nigroviridis the two tenascin genes are separated by only 10 kb on chromosome 15  , and in mouse the two tenascin genes are only 15 kb away from each other on chromosome 1. Despite the differences in numbers of FN type III domains  , each of the tenascin-W genes listed above is found in each genome immediately adjacent to the tenascin-R gene and encoded in the opposite orientation.\n",
      "In the case of tenascin-W most of the diversity can be traced to different numbers of duplications in the third FN type III domain.

      "For example  , the C-terminus of GRK2 directly binds clathrin and this interaction has been proposed to be involved in arrestin-independent internalization 99. GRK2 associates with a large number of proteins with known roles in receptor internalization and signaling.\n",
      "The loss of rdgC function leads to light- and age-dependent retinal degeneration as a result of excessive endocytosis of stable rhodopsin-arrestin complexes 14. Drosophila rdgC encodes rhodopsin-specific phosphatase and requires rhodopsin recycling 34  , 35.\n",
      "In addition  , Netrin promotes branch growth ventrally  , orthogonal to the A-P positioning of the branch that depends on Wnts.

      "After nuclear processing  , the resulting precursor hairpin pre-miRNA is transported into the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 in complex with Ran-GTP 129.

      "This results in generation of the pre-miRNA  , which is then exported from the nucleus by Exportin-5-Ran-GTP. This is followed by cleavage of the pri-miRNA by the microprocessor complex Drosha-DGCR8 Pasha.\n",
      "An exportin/cargo relationship between Exp5 and pre-60S particles would predict a physical  , RanGTP-regulated interaction between Exp5 and pre-60S particles 62. Therefore  , we next addressed whether Exp5 could have a direct function in 60S export.\n",
      "Recently  , miRNA-10a was shown to positively regulate the expression of certain mRNAs  , including mRNAs coding for ribosomal proteins of both the small and the large subunit 61. Exp5 is an RNA-binding exportin that functions in nuclear export of miRNA precursors 56 ,59 ,60.\n",
      "In the cytoplasm  , cleavage into an approximately 22-nucleotide duplex is achieved by the RNase III Dicer 130 and its interactors TRBP and PACT 131 ,132. After nuclear processing  , the resulting precursor hairpin pre-miRNA is transported into the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 in complex with Ran-GTP 129.\n",
      "Thus  , Exp5 is the second exportin besides Crm1 required for 60S export in higher eukaryotes. Upon injection of the Exp5 antibody  , 28S rRNA and 6S rRNA  , the precursor to 5.8S rRNA  , accumulated in the nucleus  , but 18S rRNA export was unaffected.\n",
      "Once in the cytoplasm  , the RNase Dicer induces cleavage of the pre-miRNA hairpin to a double stranded mature length. This results in generation of the pre-miRNA  , which is then exported from the nucleus by Exportin-5-Ran-GTP.\n",
      "A single strand of this short dsRNA  , the mature miRNA  , is incorporated into a ribonucleoprotein complex. The pre-miRNA hairpin is exported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5 19-21 where it is further processed into a short dsRNA molecule by a second ribonuclease III-like enzyme  , Dicer 22-24.\n",
      "These include cleavage of the pri-miRNA by Drosha  , export of the pre-miRNA to nucleus by exportin-5  , cleavage of the pre-miRNA by Dicer  , and miRNA strand selection for inclusion in the microprocessor complex. Subsequent processes that recognize sequence or structural features of the miRNA precursor could therefore potentially be affected by RNA editing.\n",
      "To test this  , we first purified a pre-60S particle from HEK293 cells by tandem affinity purification TAP using the TAP-tagged trans-acting factor MRTO4 homologous to yeast Mrt4 as bait Figure 6 and Figure S8. An exportin/cargo relationship between Exp5 and pre-60S particles would predict a physical  , RanGTP-regulated interaction between Exp5 and pre-60S particles 62.\n",
      "In the cytoplasm  , pre-miRNAs are subsequently cleaved by a second RNase III enzyme  , Dicer  , into approximately 22-nucleotide miRNA duplexes  , with an end structure characteristic of RNase III cleavage 42–44. Pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm by the protein Exportin 5  , which recognizes the two-nucleotide 3′ overhang that is a signature of RNase III-mediated cleavage 39–41.\n",
      "Pre-60S particles were purified from HEK293 cells Input ZPR9-TAP  , MTRO4-TAP bearing either an inducible copy of TAP-tagged MRTO4 or TAP-tagged ZPR9 24 h after tetracycline addition. Exportin 5 binds to pre-60S particles isolated on two different TAP-tagged pre-60S-associated trans-acting factors.\n",
      "Overall  , the observed RanGTP-dependent binding of Crm1 and Exp5 to pre-60S TAP particles reflects a bona fide exportin/cargo interaction. The addition of competitor pre-miRNA to the binding reaction inhibited Exp5 binding but left Crm1 binding unaffected Figure S8C  , showing that Crm1 binds independently of Exp5 and indicating that Exp5 uses its RNA-binding interface for pre-60S particle association.\n",
      "Indeed  , it has recently been demonstrated that RNA editing of pri-miRNAs can result in suppression of processing by Drosha  , and subsequent degradation of the unprocessed edited pri-miRNA 36. These include cleavage of the pri-miRNA by Drosha  , export of the pre-miRNA to nucleus by exportin-5  , cleavage of the pre-miRNA by Dicer  , and miRNA strand selection for inclusion in the microprocessor complex.\n",
      "The genes contained in this list include several factors involved in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm  , such as an exportin-1 homolog AAA.454ESTABI.20917  , and several transcripts encoding components of the nuclear pore  , such as the nuclear pore complex protein nup160 AAA.454ESTABI.24286. Furthermore  , a strong enrichment was also found for RNA transport Figure 11d.\n",
      "The pre-miRNA hairpin is exported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5 19-21 where it is further processed into a short dsRNA molecule by a second ribonuclease III-like enzyme  , Dicer 22-24. In the nucleus  , the ribonuclease III-like enzyme Drosha cleaves at the base of this stem-loop to liberate a miRNA precursor pre-miRNA as a 60-70-nucleotide RNA hairpin 18.\n",
      "Pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm by the protein Exportin 5  , which recognizes the two-nucleotide 3′ overhang that is a signature of RNase III-mediated cleavage 39–41. miRNA maturation begins with cleavage of the pri-miRNAs by the nuclear RNase III Drosha 36–38 to release approximately 70-nucleotide hairpin-shaped structures  , called precursor miRNAs pre-miRNAs.\n",
      "Within the silencing complex  , metazoan miRNAs pair to the mRNAs of protein-coding genes  , usually through imperfect base-pairing with the 3′-UTR  , thereby specifying the posttranscriptional repression of these target mRNAs 6 ,30.

A diverse set of additional molecular partners  , each associating specifically with a selective domain of RanBP2  , are likely to impart and integrate additional roles to RanBP2.\n",
      "Investigating the organisation of this former LBX3/TLX3 locus  , we found that TLX3 is on one side linked to the gene that encodes for Ran-binding protein 17 RANBP17  , a member of the Exportin protein family  , the gene encoding for the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor GABRP  , a further KCNIP gene  , KCNIP1  , the Lymphocyte cytosolic protein gene LCP2  , the Forkhead transcription factor gene FOXI1  , the Dedicator of cytokinesis gene DOCK2  , the coil-coil domain encoding CCDC99 gene  , followed by SLIT3. 2  , Additional file 1.\n",
      "Interestingly  , CBs have been traditionally associated with nuclear pores 13 ,60  , and  , overall  , these observations link the enrichment of splicing machinery  , RNA transport machinery and CBs and suggest a framework where CBs play a central role in orchestrating the regulation of gene expression in NBs  , with a strong role for PTGR mechanisms. The genes contained in this list include several factors involved in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm  , such as an exportin-1 homolog AAA.454ESTABI.20917  , and several transcripts encoding components of the nuclear pore  , such as the nuclear pore complex protein nup160 AAA.454ESTABI.24286.\n",
      "RanBP2 itself was also found to exhibit SUMO1 E3 ligase activity 17  , supporting a direct link between RanBP2-mediated SUMO-1 substrate modification and relocation of SUMO-1 modified cytosolic substrates e.g.  , RanGAP to the cytosolic face of the nuclear pore complex NPC 18.

      "To study the effect of the F35L substitution on claudin-9 localization in vivo  , we performed immunohistochemistry experiments with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the unique C-terminus of claudin-9. Overall  , our observations indicate that the F35L amino acid substitution did not prevent claudin-9 from localizing to the plasma membrane in the hearing organ.\n",
      "The increased transepithelial resistance of claudin-9-expressing epithelia suggested that claudin-9 reduced the paracellular permeability for some of the ions in the assay buffer.

      "The claudin-9 sequence is highly conserved between mouse and human Figure S9  , which raises the possibility that a claudin-9 deficiency may cause hearing loss not only in mice but also in humans. Although the DNA donor carrying this nonsynonymous SNP was heterozygous for the R116C alteration  , future studies may identify deaf patients homozygous for genetic alterations in claudin-9.\n",

Based on the established activities of Glypicans as positive modulators of BMP signaling and BMP mobility in other systems  , we speculate that this preferential expression of glypican 5 may bias BMP2/4 mobility towards the dorsal side and may increase the ability of BMP2/4 to bind to its receptor.\n",
      "Finally  , we report that Chordin may not be required for diffusibility of BMP2/4 and that BMP2/4 signaling induces a positive feedback mechanism in responsive cells by inducing the expression of glypican 5  , a positive regulator of BMP signaling and mobility.

B The Chordin/BMP2/4 complexes produced on the ventral side of the embryo can nevertheless diffuse towards the dorsal side of the embryo where Tolloid/BMP1 releases free BMP2/4 ligands that  , in the absence of Chordin  , can bind to their receptors and trigger Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and nuclearization.\n",

Mathematical modeling of BMP signaling during D/V patterning as well as experimental studies in other signaling pathways predict that positive feedback circuits can convert graded inputs into all or no outputs leading to production of bistable signaling states in which there is a sharp transition between cells displaying a high level of signaling and cells with very low signaling 63 ,64.\n",
      "Whereas the autonomous effects on tissue size caused by deregulation of these tumor suppressor pathways are most probably due  , as least in part see below  , to the capacity of Dally to facilitate Dpp spreading throughout the tissue  , we propose that the nonautonomous effects on cell number are a consequence of withdrawal of Dpp from neighboring tissues Fig 8A. We show that the glypican Dally  , which plays a major role in regulating the spread of Dpp in Drosophila tissues 49–52 ,59  , is up-regulated upon deregulation of these tumor suppressor pathways and that the increase in Dally expression levels contributes to the autonomous effects on tissue size and to the nonautonomous reduction in cell number.\n",
      "During the initial stages of BMP signaling in the PCV  , at 15–18 hours after pupariation AP  , the dorsal and ventral wing epithelia form a sack that retains only a few dorsal to ventral connections from earlier stages; the inner  , basal side of the sack is filled with extracellular matrix ECM proteins  , both diffusely and in laminar aggregates Fig 1B 19–24. PCV development takes place in a complex and changing extracellular environment  , but while there is some evidence that PCV-specific BMP signaling can be influenced by changes in tissue morphology 18 or loss of the cell-bound glypican heparan sulfate proteoglycans 17  , other aspects of the environment have not been greatly investigated.\n",

This nonautonomous effect is a consequence of a reduction in both cell size and proliferation rates cell number  , and it is not a consequence of programmed cell death or the withdrawal of nutrients from neighboring tissues  , as reducing the levels of proapoptotic genes or subjecting larvae to different amino-acid diets does not have any impact on the size reduction of neighboring cell populations.\n",

      "This protein is induced early in the G1 phase of cell cycle  , and the complex formed between cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin D1 is critical for phosphorylation of substrates that are essential for cell proliferation. Furthermore  , in our hands  , activation of these signaling pathways in MCF-7 cells was associated with the induction of cyclin D1 expression.\n",

      "This result indicates that the cyclin D subfamily arose in early eukaryotes  , and that the absence of cyclin D in fungi and many other unicellular organisms may be due to lineage-specific gene loss in these organisms. The Blast E-value for this protein against human cyclin D is approximately 1 × 10−15.\n",
      "An increase in cyclin E level as a result of NHERF1 loss may speed up the process of Rb phosphorylation and subsequent E2F-mediated gene transcription for S-phase entry. Phosphorylation of Rb is believed to be triggered initially by cyclin D-dependent kinase and then accelerated by cyclin E-cdk2 complex 36 ,37.\n",
      "Given the contributing role of cyclin E in mammary gland hyperplasia and tumourigenesis 38 ,39  , it is conceivable that the deregulation of cyclin E as a result of NHERF1 loss contributes to the breast cancer initiation or progression. It is not clear at present how decreased NHERF1 expression enhances the cyclin E level.\n",

      "ATX-3 knockdown leads to an inhibition of p53 transcriptional activities  , thus relieving its suppression on cyclin B1  , resulting in its increased expression. This is because p53 acts as a repressor for cyclin B1.\n",
      "The basis of Perk haploinsufficiency likely reflects dose-dependent signaling duration and/or intensity. This likely reflects dysregulation of cyclin D1  , given previous work that associates cyclin D1/CDK4 function with senescence 84  , 85.\n",
      "Thus  , it remains a likely possibility that high cyclin E activity is capable of driving proliferation in actively dividing cells in the absence of dE2F  , but not in cells during the cell cycle exit where cyclin E appears to require an assist from dE2F1 to sustain unscheduled cell proliferation. We also note that Yki-dependent induction of cyclin E this work and cyclin B our unpublished observations still occurs in de2f1 deficient cells posterior to the SMW  , yet these cells fail to proliferate posterior to the SMW.\n",
      "Cyclin D subfamily orthologs can be found in the early-emerging  , non-opisthokont apusozoan Thecamonas trahens. The cyclin B subfamily is conserved in D. discoideum  , fungi  , and animals  , whereas cyclin A and E subfamilies are both present in animals and their unicellular relatives such as choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis and filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki  , but are absent in fungi and D. discoideum.\n",
      "Since cyclin proteolysis as well as CDK inactivation is sufficient for completion of cytokinesis  , it was possible that the multiseptated phenotype we observed was purely due to partial proteolysis of cyclin B and/or re-entry into a subsequent round of mitosis. The nuc2-663 mutant has been shown to be capable of partially proteolyzing the mitotic B-type cyclin  , Cdc13p 42.\n",
      "Proteolysis of cyclin B and thereby the inactivation of CDK activity is triggered by a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase  , termed the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome APC/C 36 ,37. In particular  , since the localization of Sid1p to the SPB depends on cyclin B proteolysis and cyclin dependent kinase CDK inactivation  , it has been proposed that the SIN might link cytokinesis to mitotic exit 22.\n",
      "Expression of cell cycle related genes encoding cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases were analyzed Figure 4A; Dataset S18. Cyclin-dependent kinases  , their regulatory subunits  , activators  , and associated proteins showed almost continuous transcript abundance with a maximum during blastula  , gastrula  , and segmentation stages Figure 4A  , indicating their continuous involvement in the regulation of one or other cyclin genes during the cell cycle.\n",
      "Low fat intake was associated with high proliferation and cyclin D1 overexpression  , whereas high fat intake was associated with overexpression of cyclin E. Following adjustment for energy intake  , the differences between subgroups were similar although less pronounced Table 5. Low energy intake was associated with nucleus grade 3 tumours as well as overexpression of cyclin D1 and high proliferation Table 4.\n",
      "KIF7 depleted cells responded similarly with the exception that nocodazole treatment restored cyclin b levels to normal  , reduced pCDK2 and pRB  , and partially restored p21 levels to normal  , suggesting that increased microtubule stability contributes to the phenotypes observed in KIF7 depleted cells Fig 8A. Depolymerization of microtubules by nocodazole administration also led to increased cyclin d1  , cyclin b  , pNPM  , and decreased p21 levels.\n",
      "Therefore  , under our study conditions  , GCN2 does not contribute to cell cycle regulation by modulating levels of cyclin D1. S5E Fig shows that cyclin D1 levels decreased over time in both cell lines.\n",
      "Conversely  , immunoblots of nocodazole synchronized KIF7 depleted cells showed that the inhibition of Kif7 expression led to reduced expression of cyclin a  , cyclin b  , and active CDK1 at the G2/M checkpoint Fig 6I. Immunoblots of lysates from nocodazole arrested GFP and KIF7-GFP expressing cells determined that KIF7-GFP overexpressing cells contained elevated levels of cyclin B at the G2/M checkpoint Fig 6H.\n",
