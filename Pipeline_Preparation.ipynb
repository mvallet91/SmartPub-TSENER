      "Over the years, the question of the biological plausibility of the backpropaga-\n",
      "tion algorithm, implementing stochastic gradient descent in neural networks,\n",
      "has been raised multiple times. The question has gained further relevance\n",
      "due to the numerous successes achieved by backpropagation in a variety of\n",
      "problems ranging from computer vision [18, 27, 26, 12] to speech recognition\n",
      "[10] in engineering, and from high energy physics [6, 23] to biology [7, 28, 1]\n",
      "in the natural sciences, as well to recent results showing that backpropaga-\n",
      "tion is optimal in some sense [5]. There are however, several well known\n",
      "issues facing biological neural networks in relation to backpropagation, these\n",
      "include: (1) the continuous real-valued nature of the gradient information\n",
      "and its ability to change sign, violating Dale’s Law; (2) the need for some\n",
      "kind of teacher’s signal to provide targets; (3) the need for implementing all\n",
      "the (linear) operations involved in backpropagation; (4) the need for multi-\n",
      "plying by the derivatives of the forward activations; (5) the need for precise\n",
      "alternation between forward and backward passes; (6) the complex geome-\n",
      "try of biological neurons and the problem of transmitting error signals with\n",
      "precision to individual synapses. However, the most formidable obstacle is\n",
      "perhaps that the standard backpropagation algorithm requires propagating\n",
      "error signals backwards using synaptic weights that are identical to the corre-\n",
      "sponding forward weights. Furthermore, a related problem that has not been\n",
      "sufficiently recognized, is that the backpropagation weight symmetry would\n",
      "have to be maintained at all times during learning, and not just during early\n",
      "neural development. It is hard to imagine mechanisms by which biological\n",
      "neurons could both create and maintain such perfect symmetry. However,\n",
      "recent simulations [21, 20] seem to indicate surprisingly that such symmetry\n",
      "may not be required after all, and that in fact backpropagation works more\n",
      "or less as well when random weights are used to backpropagate the errors.\n",
      "Our general goal here is to investigate backpropagation with random weights\n",
      "and better understand why it works. We believe the foundation for better\n",
      "understanding random backpropagation (RBP) is provided by the concepts\n",

      "random feedback weights used for learning in the top layer. In other words,\n",
      "BP=RBP=SRBP for the top layer.\n",
      "Fact 2: For a given input, if the sign of T−O is changed, all the weights up-\n",
      "dates are changed in the opposite direction. This is true of all the algorithms\n",
      "considered here–BP, RBP, and their variants–even when the derivatives of\n",

      "Fact 3: In all RBP algorithms, if T −O = 0 (online or in batch mode) then\n",
      "for all the weights ∆whij = 0 (on line or in batch mode).\n",
      "Fact 4: Congruence of weights is not necessary. However it can be helpful\n",
      "sometimes and speed up learning. This can easily be seen in simple cases.\n",
      "For instance, consider a linear or non-linear A[N0, N1, 1] architecture with\n",
      "coherent weights, and denote by a the weights in the bottom layer, by b the\n",
      "weights in the top layer, and by c the weights in the learning channel. Then,\n",
      "for all variants of RBP, all the weights updates are in the same direction as\n",
      "the gradient. This is obvious for the top layer (Fact 1 above). For the first\n",
      "layer of weights, the changes are given by ∆w1ij = η(T −O)ciIj, which is very\n",
      "similar to the change produced by gradient descent ∆1ij = η(T −O)biIj since\n",
      "ci and bi are assumed to be coherent. So while the dynamics of the lower layer\n",
      "is not exactly in the gradient direction, it is always in the same orthant as\n",
      "the gradient and thus downhill with respect to the error function. Additional\n",
      "examples showing the positive but not necessary effect of coherence are given\n",
      "in Section 7.\n",
      "Fact 5: SRBP seems to perform well showing that the upper derivatives\n",
      "are not needed. However the derivative of the corresponding layer seem\n",
      "to matter. In general, for the activation functions considered here, these\n",
      "derivatives tend to be between 0 and 1. Thus learning is attenuated for\n",
      "neurons that are saturated. So an ingredient that seems to matter is to let\n",
      "the synapses of neurons that are not saturated change more than the synapses\n",

      "Fact 6: Consider a multi-class classification problem, such as MNIST. All\n",

      "images in the “1” class will tend to produce a more or less uniform error\n",
      "vector similar to (−0.1, 0.9, . . . ,−0.1), which is essentially orthogonal to the\n",

      "associated with 10 roughly orthogonal error vectors. When these vectors are\n",
