The four CDSs encode DTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase  , glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase  , DTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3 ,5-epimerase and DTDP-glucose 4 ,6-dehydratase. Four 027 unique genes upstream of the flagella F1 region CDR20291_0223-0226 and CD196_0236-0239 that are absent in 630 may be involved in virulence.Despite its popularity  , the notion of dimerization-driven activation of initiator caspases is at odds with some well-known facts. Along this line  , the activation of caspase-8 requires the assembly of a multi-component death-inducing signaling complex  , which has a 3-fold symmetry.CR performed the GFP reporter assays. TJN performed the Netrin-1 experiments.F Growth cone β-catenin staining pixel intensity measured after 10 minutes  , 1 hour  , or 24 hours exposure to Netrin-1 expressed relative to untreated controls. D Cultured thalamic explant immunostained for β-catenin with higher magnification of a growth cone in box shown in E.The most parsimonious explanation of these observations is that the anterior part and thus the head of bilaterians is derived from the aboral domain of the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. This suggests that in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians  , aboral i.e.  , contrablastoporal development was controlled by six3/6 and the aboral domain was additionally characterized by the expression of foxQ2  , frizzled 5/8  , rx  , irx  , and probably FGF signalling genes and foxD1.The conserved expression of netrin in Ciona 54 and in Oikopleura suggests that the tunicate notochord  , in addition to its structural role  , is able to provide some essential positional cues to the developing nervous system. In higher chordates  , the notochord is known to serve a dual function: providing structural support to the developing embryo  , and secreting patterning signals required for tissue specification and organogenesis 1.For example  , the autoactivation of caspase-9 is mediated by the assembly of a heptameric complex involving Apaf-1 and cytochrome c  , dubbed the apoptosome 7–9. The autoactivation of the initiator caspases is facilitated by other auxiliary factors.YopJ acetylates serine and threonine residues of MAP kinase family members  , which blocks the phosphorylation site needed for downstream immune signaling 37 ,38. YopJ  , the founding member of the HopZ/YopJ superfamily  , has recently been shown to possess acetyltransferase activity 36–38.We now provide the first direct evidence for EGL-4 function in the ASH nociceptive neurons  , and show that it acts to negatively regulate G protein-coupled signal transduction and dampen behavioral sensitivity to the bitter tastant quinine. Animals lacking the DOS-motif Notch co-ligand OSM-11 do not effectively avoid 100% octanol  , and this defect is partially suppressed by the gain-of-function egl-4ad450 allele 82.A In situ hybridisation for Netrin-1 mRNA purple signal on a coronal E14.5 forebrain section. Effect of Netrin-1 on thalamic cells and axons.Comparison of their sequences with known Frizzled family genes grouped them with Drosophila fz vertebrate frizzled 1/2/3/6/7 and Drosophila fz3 and fz4 vertebrate frizzled 4  , 9  , and10  , and they were named CheFz1 and CheFz3 in line with the Drosophila genes Figure 1B. Both of the Clytia cDNAs identified encode classical Frizzled family receptors containing seven transmembrane segments  , a cysteine-rich domain implicated in ligand binding  , and a KTXXXW motif essential for the activation of the Wnt–β-catenin pathway 25 ,26 Figure 1A.c-f Effect of exogenous addition of sFRP-1 on adipocyte development. EBs were left untreated control  , solid line or incubated with 100 ng/ml of recombinant sFRP-1 secreted frizzled-related protein-1; dashed line from days 3 to 6.We find that the 3'UTR of β-catenin mRNA is sufficient to direct protein expression to the axon. We find that Netrin-1 induces β-catenin mediated transcriptional activity in thalamic cells and induces rapid changes in the growth cone levels of β-catenin protein.The rapid changes in β-catenin protein levels in growth cones exposed to Netrin-1 suggest rapid β-catenin protein synthesis  , perhaps followed by its degradation or movement away from the growth cone  , in response to guidance cues. Our data so far suggest a possible role for β-catenin in thalamic axon navigation.Other proteins such as Netrin-1  , Slit2 and NG2 mediate OPC migration through modulation of RhoA signaling 70–72. The RhoA signaling axis is becoming of increasing interest with regard to MS therapeutics.Importantly  , it has been previously shown that loss of dbruce function causes degeneration of spermatid nuclei and male sterility  , suggesting that dBruce function in spermatids is tightly controlled to prevent unrestrained caspase activity 12 ,24. These results suggest that dBruce is at least one of the substrates for the Cullin-3–based E3-ligase complex.We previously suggested that XIAP in the NLRP1 inflammasome complex may inhibit caspase-1 activity preventing the activation and processing of IL-1β and IL-18 3-5. Moreover  , the inflammasome in normal tissues is speculated to be in an inactive state by binding to a putative inhibitor 21  , but the nature of this inhibitor has not been identified.Neurite branching is also patterned by inhibitory signals. For example  , locally applied nerve growth factor NGF or Netrin-1 induce de novo interstitial branch formation in cultured cortical neurons 2  , 3.These 147 genes absent from M. hominis mainly encoded proteins involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism PtsH  , PtsG  , PtsI  , 6-phosphofructokinase  , glycerol kinase  , pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or in cytadherence and virulence MgPa  , MgpC  , P32  , P200  , cytadherence accessory proteins Hmw1  , 2 and 3. However  , when the 537 M. hominis protein-coding genes were compared with this set  , 147 38% were absent from the M. hominis genome data not shown.To further investigate possible interactions between dBruce and the Cul3-Roc1b-Klhl10 complex  , we tested whether the substrate recruitment protein Klhl10 can bind to dBruce. dBruce function is necessary to protect sperm against unwanted caspase activity  , because loss of dbruce function causes degeneration of spermatid nuclei and male sterility 12 ,24.Local translation of mRNAs in growth cones is a well established mechanism to facilitate rapid changes in growth cone protein levels in response to guidance cues including Netrin-1 so we hypothesised that thalamic axons might contain β-catenin mRNA 44-56. While the relationship between the Wnt response and β-catenin is well established  , β-catenin's relationship with Netrin-1 is not  , so we next used in vitro assays to show that Netrin-1 treatment causes an increase in levels of β-catenin protein in thalamic growth cones and induces β-catenin dependent gene expression in thalamic cells.In contrast  , unc-5  , unc-40 and clr-1 are not elevated in larval VA motor neurons  , which consequently innervate muscles on the ventral side. The dorsal trajectory of DA motor neuron outgrowth depends on the UNC-6/netrin receptor genes  , unc-5 and unc-40  , and the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase RPTP clr-1 gene 90 ,91  , all three of which are enriched in the embryonic A-class dataset Figure 12.We next turned our attention to the distribution of β-catenin mRNA in the thalamocortical system  , particularly in the axons and growth cones where mRNAs might be locally translated. The rapid changes in β-catenin protein levels in growth cones exposed to Netrin-1 suggest rapid β-catenin protein synthesis  , perhaps followed by its degradation or movement away from the growth cone  , in response to guidance cues.If Klhl10 is indeed a physiologically relevant Cullin-3 binding partner in vivo  , mutations in klhl10 should affect the function of this E3 complex and thus block caspase activation. Collectively  , these results suggest that Cul3Testis interacts functionally and physically with Roc1b and Klhl10 to promote caspase activation and spermatid individualization in Drosophila.All embryos are oriented with anterior to the left. A-I Microphotographs of Oikopleura embryos at the mid-tailbud/early hatchling A  , late tailbud B  , Stage 1 C ,E-I  , and Stage 2 D  , hybridized in situ with a digoxigenin-labeled Od-netrin antisense probe.V5-tagged TNFR1  , human Fas  , mouse Fas  , p75  , FADD  , or Caspase-8 was transfected into CrmA/Flag-p45/293 stable cells. B P45 forms a complex with FADD and p75.B LacZ mRNA levels in cultured BAT-gal thalamic explants. B ,C mRNA levels measured after 90 minutes exposure to Netrin-1 expressed relative to untreated controls.One possibility is that the apoptosome may directly activate monomeric caspase-9 through modification of its active site conformation 8 ,12. The activation of another initiator caspase  , caspase-8  , is facilitated by the death-inducing signaling complex  , which involves a homotrimeric 3-fold symmetry assembly of the death receptor and other associated factors.Wnt signaling is initiated upon the binding of Wnt ligands to Frizzled and lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 LRP5/6 receptors. The level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in stem cells is meticulously regulated  , while different activation levels of the signaling result in distinct fate decisions by stem cells 4–6.VAs do not express these receptors and project ventrally directed axons. DA axons are steered dorsally by interaction of the repulsive cue UNC-6 netrin with receptors  , UNC-40 DCC and UNC-5  , and the CLR-1 receptor tyrosine phosphatase 90 ,91.Signaling by the death-receptor proteins  , such as Fas and TNF-R1  , leads to the formation of the death-induced silencing complex DISC consisting of death-receptor  , FADD  , and caspase-8 which initiates the caspase cascade 32. However  , how matrix detachment leads to the activation of the death-receptor pathway in these cells needs to be further explored.Although the complex has been linked to protein degradation before  , its role in caspase regulation came as a surprise. provide support for this scenario by showing that an enzyme complex activates caspases by degrading their inhibitors during Drosophila sperm differentiation.bassianolide synthetase ABR28366  , 30% identity/48% similarity. Similarity was also detected with the hypothetical or putative 2-dehydropantoate reductases from Gibberella zeae PH-1 anamorph: F. graminearum and F. oxysporum Fo5176 EGU84839  , 49% identity; and EGU75687  , 47% identity  , respectively  , and also with functionally uncharacterized terminal reductase domain of the Xylaria sp.Here we provide evidence that a Cullin-3–based multiprotein complex plays a critical role in caspase activation in Drosophila. Given the conserved nature of these proteins  , our findings may have important implications for caspase regulation in other systems.The inflammasome in hippocampal neurons is a protein complex containing NLRP1 as a scaffolding protein that activates caspase-1 to promote IL-1β and IL-18 maturation associated with aging see additional file 1 for immunoblotting results of IL1β and IL-18 in young and aged rats. Therefore  , aging-related XIAP cleavage may reduce the threshold for activation of caspase-1  , leading to processing and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18.Consequent abolishing or titrating away of the APC/Axin/GSK3 complex leads to β-catenin accumulation and translocation to the nucleus where it binds to Tcf/Lef family members  , activating target gene expression 3. Wnt signaling is initiated upon the binding of Wnt ligands to Frizzled and lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 LRP5/6 receptors.Together these experiments support the model that Wnts along the A-P axis and Netrin along the D-V axis interact orthogonally to pattern branch outgrowth in the PLM neuron Fig 8. When unc-6 was expressed dorsally in the mig-1 mutant  , we found that dorsally-routed PLM branches developed at ectopic locations along the A-P axis Fig 7D.Once activated  , caspase-9 cleaves and activates caspases-3 and -7. For example  , the autoactivation of caspase-9 is mediated by the assembly of a heptameric complex involving Apaf-1 and cytochrome c  , dubbed the apoptosome 7–9.This experiment demonstrates rapid and dynamic fluctuations in growth cone β-catenin concentration in response to the thalamocortical guidance cue Netrin-1. One day after adding Netrin-1 values were similar to those in untreated growth cones.After 1-hour exposure to Netrin-1  , the β-catenin signal in the growth cones was reduced by 19%. Ten minutes of exposure to Netrin-1 caused a 22% increase in β-catenin signal.This suggests that in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians  , aboral i.e.  , contrablastoporal development was controlled by six3/6 and the aboral domain was additionally characterized by the expression of foxQ2  , frizzled 5/8  , rx  , irx  , and probably FGF signalling genes and foxD1. Integration of the data presented here with studies in other cnidarians and in bilaterians shows that the aboral domain of cnidarians and the head-forming anterior domain of bilaterians share the expression of several transcription factors and signalling molecules Figures 9 and S1.The Nematostella vectensis genome trace archive also contains Frizzled family sequences in both these groups  , as well as in the Drosophila fz2 vertebrate 5/8 group 18  , indicating that the main frizzled gene subfamilies were founded before the bilaterian-cnidarian divergence. Comparison of their sequences with known Frizzled family genes grouped them with Drosophila fz vertebrate frizzled 1/2/3/6/7 and Drosophila fz3 and fz4 vertebrate frizzled 4  , 9  , and10  , and they were named CheFz1 and CheFz3 in line with the Drosophila genes Figure 1B.Other fiber elongation-related genes  , e.g.  , profilin and its partners  , were also up-regulated in domesticated cottons at 10 dpa Figure 3  , Figure S7  , including members of one sub-clade of ACT7 Figure 3. This indicates that CslC and CslD genes have become up-regulated by domestication early in fiber development.TJN performed the Netrin-1 experiments. JWD performed the qRT-PCR and in situ hybridisation and participated in the design of the study.This association has further strengthened the need to evaluate other possible gene variants that may play a role in therapeutic efficacy. We recently found that the combination of the MnSOD -9 genotype and the myeloperoxidase genotype led to a threefold decrease in the hazard of death among women treated for breast cancer 19.On the other hand  , inactivation of apoptosis by blocking upstream death signals or inhibition of caspase activity by IAP complex formation is central to cancer development and cellular resistance of cells against anticancer agents 3-5. Neuronal death due to aberrant apoptosis underlies the symptoms of various neurological disorders  , such as Alzheimer's  , Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases  , stroke  , amyotropic lateral sclerosis ALS  , multiple sclerosis MS and spinal muscular atrophy 2.Profilin has a higher affinity for ADP-Pi-actin than for ADP-actin at the barbed end  , with dissociation constants of 5.9±2.4 µM and 28.1±5.1 µM  , respectively  , obtained by fitting the saturation curves Figure 4C assuming that profilin is in rapid equilibrium with the barbed end. Having measured the impact of profilin on   ,   , and   , we can compute its impact on  following the reaction scheme of Figure 3 and find that profilin accelerates Pi release at the barbed end of actin filaments Figure 4D.Similarity was also detected with the hypothetical or putative 2-dehydropantoate reductases from Gibberella zeae PH-1 anamorph: F. graminearum and F. oxysporum Fo5176 EGU84839  , 49% identity; and EGU75687  , 47% identity  , respectively  , and also with functionally uncharacterized terminal reductase domain of the Xylaria sp. KivRFp shared the highest sequence identity with the KIVR from B. bassiana ATCC 7159 ACI30654  , 61% identity/75% similarity  , followed by the putative 2-ketopantoate reductase from Metarhizium acridum CQMa 102 EFY89891  , 56% identity/70% similarity.This shows that the Cul3-Roc1b-Klhl10 complex is required for activation of effector caspase  , but not for other individualization events  , such as axonemal tubulin polyglycylation. Secondly  , mutations in any of the three cullin-3 complex genes retain AXO 49 staining  , which has a temporal pattern of expression virtually identical with CM1-staining.As shown in Figure 2B there was a significant increase in LacZ mRNA in cultures exposed to Netrin-1 for 90 minutes compared to untreated controls  , showing that Netrin-1 can induce β-catenin mediated transcription in thalamic cells. We used qRT-PCR to measure levels of LacZ mRNA in thalamic cultures prepared from BAT-gal embryos.Having measured the impact of profilin on   ,   , and   , we can compute its impact on  following the reaction scheme of Figure 3 and find that profilin accelerates Pi release at the barbed end of actin filaments Figure 4D. We show that profilin increases   , in agreement with earlier studies in solution 30  , and that it also increases  Figure 4C.An example of a cultured thalamic explant  , immunostained with β-catenin  , is shown in Figure 2D. In order to monitor the response of thalamic cells to Netrin-1 we employed a culture system in which thalamic explants were cultured on glass coverslips and allowed to extend axons.This forms the death-inducing signaling complex DISC. TRAIL binds to its receptors TRAIL-R1 DR4 or TRAIL-R2 DR5 on the cell surface  , leading to the recruitment of the adaptor molecule FADD and pro-caspase-8 4.Multicellular organisms maintain homeostasis through a balance between cell proliferation and death. On the other hand  , inactivation of apoptosis by blocking upstream death signals or inhibition of caspase activity by IAP complex formation is central to cancer development and cellular resistance of cells against anticancer agents 3-5.What restrains the lethal machinations of caspases to allow selective degradation of subcellular components is not clear  , though there is evidence that inhibitory proteins called inhibitor of apoptosis proteins  , or IAPs may prevent caspase activation at inappropriate times. Although the complex has been linked to protein degradation before  , its role in caspase regulation came as a surprise.We therefore examined whether loss of roc1b function affects caspase activation and individualization of spermatids. Furthermore  , Cullin-3 preferentially co-immunoprecipitates with Roc1b  , indicating that both proteins form a complex 74.Netrin-1 is known to be a key regulator of thalamocortical development 14 ,15. First we use in situ hybridisation  , immunohistochemistry  , and a BAT-gal reporter transgene to show that β-catenin is expressed at high levels both in cell bodies and in axons in the developing thalamus and that β-catenin mediated transcription is very active in thalamic cells at this time.In contrast  , the mechanism for the activation of the initiator caspases  , which generally involves the formation of an oligomeric complex 9  , has remained elusive 12. Induced proximity  , interpreted as dimerization-driven activation of caspases  , is perceived as a dominant model of initiator caspase activation 19–21 ,23.The dorsal trajectory of DA motor neuron outgrowth depends on the UNC-6/netrin receptor genes  , unc-5 and unc-40  , and the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase RPTP clr-1 gene 90 ,91  , all three of which are enriched in the embryonic A-class dataset Figure 12. During embryonic development  , DA motor neurons extend commissures that circumnavigate the body wall to innervate dorsal muscles.Several PCGs are expressed at the planarian poles  , but have broader expression domains that extend beyond the cluster of notum
+ or wnt1
+ cells at the animal head and tail tips. PCGs expressed broadly in the posterior region of the animal include genes encoding additional Wnt ligands  , wnt11-1  , wnt11-2  , and wntP-2/wnt11-5 and the Wnt receptor frizzled-4
6  , 7  , 14  , 15  , 18; Hox genes are also expressed in the posterior 14.To test this hypothesis  , we searched for loss-of-function mutations in this gene. If Klhl10 is indeed a physiologically relevant Cullin-3 binding partner in vivo  , mutations in klhl10 should affect the function of this E3 complex and thus block caspase activation.Assembly and activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome involves caspase -1 and -11 activation that subsequently leads to maturation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 4-6. The neuronal NLRP1 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex consisting of inflammatory caspases-1 and -11  , NLRP1  , the adaptor protein ASC and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP.This analysis reveals that many genes involved in fiber elongation were over-expressed in domesticated cottons  , including profilin 1  , HXXXD-type acyl-transferase family protein  , expansin A8  , beta-6 tubulin  , FASCICLIN-like arabinogalactan 9 FLA9  , and 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 2 KCS2 Table 3. Among the 3 ,581 genes differentially expressed between wild and domesticated cotton at 10 dpa  , we tabulated the most highly up-regulated genes in wild or domesticated cottons  , relative to their counterparts  , with respect to fold change with RPKM≧50.D Effect of profilin on the Pi release rate constant at the barbed end  ,   , computed based on the molecular scheme shown in Figure 3  , and fitted by a saturation curve assuming that profilin is in rapid equilibrium with the barbed end. The lines are saturation curves fitting the data  , assuming that profilin is in rapid equilibrium with the barbed end of the filaments.Through a series of gene deletion and protein interaction experiments  , the researchers identified two proteins Roc1b and Klhl10 that form a complex with Cullin-3 to promote caspase activation and spermatid individualization in the fruit fly. Fruit flies and mammals share many aspects of spermatid individualization  , and human fertility requires the Cullin-3 enzyme complex.Nevertheless  , our favored model  , in view of the privileged position of EIF-3.K and EIF-3.L in close proximity to the translational apparatus  , is that these nonessential but conserved accessary subunits of eIF3 may influence the physiology of aging and ER homeostasis through interactions with the eIF3 complex that modulate the differential translation of mRNAs. For example  , the eIF3k subunit itself has been implicated in a caspase-dependent apoptosis-promoting function 43 ,44.We find that Netrin-1 induces β-catenin mediated transcriptional activity in thalamic cells and induces rapid changes in the growth cone levels of β-catenin protein. We provide evidence that β-catenin mRNA and protein are expressed at high levels in mouse embryonic thalamic cells and their axons at the time connections are being formed with the cerebral cortex.Runx1 regulates myelopoiesis by coordinating expression of GM-CSF  , M-CSFR  , myeloperoxidase  , and neutrophil elastase 61–64. Runx1 is essential for definitive hematopoiesis 56–58  , and plays an important role in adult hematopoiesis in both lymphoid and myeloid progenitor compartments 59 ,60.For example  , the eIF3k subunit itself has been implicated in a caspase-dependent apoptosis-promoting function 43 ,44. We have also not excluded an alternative hypothesis in which EIF-3.K and EIF-3.L might regulate cellular physiology though pathways outside of the eIF3 complex and mRNA translation.The activation of another initiator caspase  , caspase-8  , is facilitated by the death-inducing signaling complex  , which involves a homotrimeric 3-fold symmetry assembly of the death receptor and other associated factors. We note that the Apaf-1-mediated apoptosome has a 7-fold symmetry.We used qRT-PCR to measure levels of LacZ mRNA in thalamic cultures prepared from BAT-gal embryos. First  , we hypothesised that the high levels of β-catenin mediated transcription we observed in the thalamus of BAT-gal embryos Figure 1G are contributed to by Netrin-1.L1 regulates thalamocortical axon fasciculation in the internal capsule and L1 mRNA is upregulated in response to β-catenin signalling in other systems  , expression of β-actin can be regulated by Netrin-1 in Xenopus retinal growth cones  , and Epha4 is required for ordered thalamocortcial axon navigation in the internal capsule and has not been linked with either β-catenin or Netrin-1 function 58-61. As shown in Figure 2B there was a significant increase in LacZ mRNA in cultures exposed to Netrin-1 for 90 minutes compared to untreated controls  , showing that Netrin-1 can induce β-catenin mediated transcription in thalamic cells.In addition  , Netrin promotes branch growth ventrally  , orthogonal to the A-P positioning of the branch that depends on Wnts. VANG-1- and arrestin-dependent Frizzled endocytosis transduces Wnt signals to polarize F-actin distribution  , which precedes and correlates with collateral branch formation.The prevailing hypothesis has been the “induced proximity” model  , which summarized a set of elegant experiments 13–17 to state that caspase zymogens are autoprocessed once they are brought into proximity with each other 18. In contrast  , the mechanism for the activation of the initiator caspases  , which generally involves the formation of an oligomeric complex 9  , has remained elusive 12.First  , we hypothesised that the high levels of β-catenin mediated transcription we observed in the thalamus of BAT-gal embryos Figure 1G are contributed to by Netrin-1. We found significant increases in the thalamic levels of β-actin and L1 mRNAs but not Epha4 mRNA following Netrin-1 treatment for 90 minutes Figure 2C.Cultures were exposed to Netrin-1 400 ng/ml  , a concentration that has previously been shown to stimulate thalamic axon growth 14. An example of a cultured thalamic explant  , immunostained with β-catenin  , is shown in Figure 2D.We recently found that the combination of the MnSOD -9 genotype and the myeloperoxidase genotype led to a threefold decrease in the hazard of death among women treated for breast cancer 19. Similarly  , the chemotherapeutic agents most commonly utilized in the treatment of breast cancer  , adriamycin and cyclophosphamide  , generate ROS that may be effected by MnSOD activity.Along this line  , the activation of caspase-8 requires the assembly of a multi-component death-inducing signaling complex  , which has a 3-fold symmetry. For example  , if the activation of the initiator caspases requires merely dimerization  , why would the apoptosome exhibit a 7-fold symmetry ?An alternative model is that the apoptosome assembles the dimeric caspase-9 into a higher-order complex  , which results in the modification of the active site conformation for an enhanced activity 12. One possibility is that the apoptosome may directly activate monomeric caspase-9 through modification of its active site conformation 8 ,12.As thalamic axons extend towards the cerebral cortex their growth cones become increasingly distant from the cell body posing a potential logistical problem if all new protein must be translocated from the cell body. A key finding in this study is the rapid increase in the levels of β-catenin protein in thalamic growth cones in response to the axon guidance cue Netrin-1.In this version of our model  , we do not explicitly simulate Ena/VASP molecules  , which can regulate actin networks by binding profilin  , competing with capping protein  , and regulating Arp2/3 spacing Krause et al. In conjunction with other proteins e.g.  , Ena/VASP  , ActA may also regulate actin dynamics in other important ways Goldberg 2001.We found significant increases in the thalamic levels of β-actin and L1 mRNAs but not Epha4 mRNA following Netrin-1 treatment for 90 minutes Figure 2C. L1 regulates thalamocortical axon fasciculation in the internal capsule and L1 mRNA is upregulated in response to β-catenin signalling in other systems  , expression of β-actin can be regulated by Netrin-1 in Xenopus retinal growth cones  , and Epha4 is required for ordered thalamocortcial axon navigation in the internal capsule and has not been linked with either β-catenin or Netrin-1 function 58-61.Moreover  , aging-induced activation of the inflammasome was found to be associated with cleavage of XIAP into fragments. We previously suggested that XIAP in the NLRP1 inflammasome complex may inhibit caspase-1 activity preventing the activation and processing of IL-1β and IL-18 3-5.While the relationship between the Wnt response and β-catenin is well established  , β-catenin's relationship with Netrin-1 is not  , so we next used in vitro assays to show that Netrin-1 treatment causes an increase in levels of β-catenin protein in thalamic growth cones and induces β-catenin dependent gene expression in thalamic cells. Netrin-1 is known to be a key regulator of thalamocortical development 14 ,15.Cultures were then either processed for β-catenin immunofluorescence or RNA extracted from the whole culture explant + axons for qRT-PCR analysis. For Netrin-1 free cultures  , 40% of the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium.Our new finding that Netrin-1 can activate TCF/LEF transcription adds to these options. While a component of thalamic TCF/LEF transcription is likely a response to Wnt signalling  , Slit proteins which are also abundant in the thalamus and tissues encountered by its axons can turn on TCF/LEF transcription when sensed by their Robo receptor 8 ,25.The activated Elk-1-p300 complex then induces a strong p300-mediated acetyltransferase activity on target genes leading to enhanced histone acetylation  , chromatin remodelling  , and gene activation 8–14. Elk-1 is activated by MAPK/ERK via phosphorylation of serine residues 383 and 389 within the transactivation domain 7  , 8  , leading to an enhanced association between Elk-1 and the histone actyltransferase HAT  , p300 9.RhoA pathway downregulation by pharmacological means enhances morphological development of OL-lineage cells 25  , 73  , 74  , even in the presence of OL-inhibitory factors 75  , 76. Other proteins such as Netrin-1  , Slit2 and NG2 mediate OPC migration through modulation of RhoA signaling 70–72.Thus  , this study provides the first example  , to our knowledge  , of a critical E3 ligase complex in directing two distinct modes of pruning and also provides mechanistic insights into how this evolutionarily conserved SCF E3 ligase attenuates a key signaling pathway to promote pruning during the maturation of the nervous system. Finally  , the SCF ligase and the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway regulate dendrite pruning in ddaC neurons at least in part by promoting local caspase activation in the dendrites.A key finding in this study is the rapid increase in the levels of β-catenin protein in thalamic growth cones in response to the axon guidance cue Netrin-1. Therefore  , while we have not directly addressed whether or not β-catenin is locally translated in thalamic growth cones in the present study  , our finding that β-catenin mRNA is present in thalamic axons and that elements in its 3'UTR assist protein expression in the thalamic axonal compartment make it a strong possibility.In addition  , it is possible that the dimerized caspase-9 in the context of the apoptosome exhibits a perturbed interface relative to the crystallographically observed interface  , which may greatly facilitate the catalytic activity of caspase-9. An alternative model is that the apoptosome assembles the dimeric caspase-9 into a higher-order complex  , which results in the modification of the active site conformation for an enhanced activity 12.In order to monitor the response of thalamic cells to Netrin-1 we employed a culture system in which thalamic explants were cultured on glass coverslips and allowed to extend axons. We next asked whether Netrin-1 treatment affects growth cone β-catenin.Ten minutes of exposure to Netrin-1 caused a 22% increase in β-catenin signal. The total pixel intensity of β-catenin indirect immunofluorescence was measured for each growth cone and values for growth cones treated with Netrin-1 were then normalised against untreated control growth cones to show fold changes in the β-catenin signal Figure 2F.The total pixel intensity of β-catenin indirect immunofluorescence was measured for each growth cone and values for growth cones treated with Netrin-1 were then normalised against untreated control growth cones to show fold changes in the β-catenin signal Figure 2F. An example of a growth cone stained for β-catenin is shown in Figure 2E.However  , this initial explanation of the induced proximity model contained little mechanistic information until it was enhanced by the proposition that the oligomeric complex such as the apoptosome serves to activate the monomeric initiator caspases through induced dimerization via their intrinsic dimerization interface 19–21. The prevailing hypothesis has been the “induced proximity” model  , which summarized a set of elegant experiments 13–17 to state that caspase zymogens are autoprocessed once they are brought into proximity with each other 18.The experimental analysis revealed a total of ten editing sites within this Alu element see Figure 1B  , including two major sites that lead to amino acid changes H/R and Q/R sites. The LUSTR1 cDNA codes for a G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor also termed GPR107 or KIAA1624  , with three AtoG discrepancies located within an alternatively spliced AluJo-derived exon that leads to the in-frame insertion of 29 amino acids between transmembrane regions V and VI of the protein see Figure 1A.We next asked whether Netrin-1 treatment affects growth cone β-catenin. This experiment demonstrates rapid and dynamic fluctuations in growth cone β-catenin concentration in response to the thalamocortical guidance cue Netrin-1.The NLRP1 inflammasome in neurons constitutes a multiprotein complex consisting of caspase-1  , caspase-11  , apoptosis-associated-speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain ASC  , NLRP1  , P2X7  , pannexin-1 and XIAP 4. Thus  , aging stimulates the expression of some of the key components of the NLRP1 inflammasome in the hippocampus  , suggesting an involvement of the inflammasome in the aging process.Secondly  , mutations in any of the three cullin-3 complex genes retain AXO 49 staining  , which has a temporal pattern of expression virtually identical with CM1-staining. This confirms our earlier result that caspase activation in this system is independent of general differentiation events 12.One day after adding Netrin-1 values were similar to those in untreated growth cones. After 1-hour exposure to Netrin-1  , the β-catenin signal in the growth cones was reduced by 19%.B ,C mRNA levels measured after 90 minutes exposure to Netrin-1 expressed relative to untreated controls. A In situ hybridisation for Netrin-1 mRNA purple signal on a coronal E14.5 forebrain section.Recently  , NLR caspase recruitment domain containing protein 5 NLRC5 was shown to regulate transcription of MHC class I MHCI genes  , primarily in lymphocytes  , where it is highly expressed 2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6. The NLR family member CIITA instead functions as the master transcriptional regulator of major histocompatibility complex MHC class II MHCII genes  , and mutations in the CIITA gene lead to severe immunodeficiency 1.Of note  , both secreted frizzled-related proteins sFRP 1 and 5  , two extracellular inhibitors of the Wnt pathway  , are strongly upregulated by CD2314 at day 6  , suggesting that an inhibition of the Wnt pathway activity  , besides its demonstrated role in adipocyte terminal differentiation  , might also be involved in the early steps of adipogenesis Figure 4a. These include wingless-related MMTV integration site 2 Wnt2  , its receptors frizzled homolog Fzd 1 and 4  , as well as dickkopf homolog 1 Dkk1 and protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B delta isoform Ppp2r2d.On the other hand  , the BIR domain region of another IAP-like protein  , dBruce  , can bind to the substrate recruitment protein Klhl10 in S2 cells Figure 10B and 10C. Whereas Diap1 is an essential caspase inhibitor in most somatic cells in Drosophila  , it appears that it is not a major substrate for the Cul3-Roc1b-Klhl10 complex  , because no significant differences in Diap1 protein levels between wild-type and cul3
−/− and klhl10
−/− mutant testes were detected Figure 10A.Death receptor-mediated signaling has been implicated in anoikis 9 ,29. Signaling by the death-receptor proteins  , such as Fas and TNF-R1  , leads to the formation of the death-induced silencing complex DISC consisting of death-receptor  , FADD  , and caspase-8 which initiates the caspase cascade 32.K-M Microphotographs of Oikopleura embryos at the mid-tailbud/early hatchling K  , Stage 1 L  , and Stage 2 M  , hybridized in situ with a digoxigenin-labeled Od-laminin α1 antisense probe. J Schematic representation of the Oikopleura notochord cells 20 numbered red squares  , followed  , for comparison purposes  , by a delineation of the Od-Hox4 green  , Od-Hox11 purple 29  , and Od-netrin blue expression patterns.It is therefore possible that at least two whole gene sets involved in cytadherence/virulence and in energy-generating carbohydrate metabolism may be replaced by two other whole gene sets facilitating similar functions in another minimal species Figure 1B. These 147 genes absent from M. hominis mainly encoded proteins involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism PtsH  , PtsG  , PtsI  , 6-phosphofructokinase  , glycerol kinase  , pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or in cytadherence and virulence MgPa  , MgpC  , P32  , P200  , cytadherence accessory proteins Hmw1  , 2 and 3.Ablation of the Schwann cell protein Periaxin disrupts Cajal bands and is also associated with reduced longitudinal growth of Schwann cells 19. Cajal bands are cytoplasmic channels located at the abaxonal surface of myelinated fibers and are involved in the biosynthesis and assembly of myelin 3.The neuronal NLRP1 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex consisting of inflammatory caspases-1 and -11  , NLRP1  , the adaptor protein ASC and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP. Our data show that aging promotes NLRP1 inflammasome activity resulting in processing of caspase-1 and upregulation of caspase-11.For example  , locally applied nerve growth factor NGF or Netrin-1 induce de novo interstitial branch formation in cultured cortical neurons 2  , 3. In addition  , diffusible  , secreted cues also regulate neurite branching.Within tunicates  , a similarly irregular pattern in notochord cells has been reported for Ciona multidom  , a Ci-Bra-downstream notochord gene that does not have counterparts in Oikopleura Additional file 1. However  , the Od-netrin pattern cannot be perfectly superimposed to the pattern seen for either of the two Od-Hox genes  , suggesting that other transcription factors and/or additional regulatory mechanisms might be modulating this peculiar expression.Although the total levels of NLRP1 and ASC in lysates did not change significantly with aging  , the proportions of other key components that form the NLRP1 inflammasome increased. The inflammasome in hippocampal neurons is a protein complex containing NLRP1 as a scaffolding protein that activates caspase-1 to promote IL-1β and IL-18 maturation associated with aging see additional file 1 for immunoblotting results of IL1β and IL-18 in young and aged rats.Upon inflammasome activation caspase-1 is cleaved into active fragments that process pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into active IL-1β and IL-18 14. The NLRP1 inflammasome in neurons constitutes a multiprotein complex consisting of caspase-1  , caspase-11  , apoptosis-associated-speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain ASC  , NLRP1  , P2X7  , pannexin-1 and XIAP 4.In this study  , we found that Twist-2 inhibited the function of the transcription factor Runx1  , which may contribute to the myeloproliferative disease observed in Twist-2 KO mice. Runx1 regulates myelopoiesis by coordinating expression of GM-CSF  , M-CSFR  , myeloperoxidase  , and neutrophil elastase 61–64.A more likely model is that the Cul3-Roc1b-Klhl10 complex promotes degradation of a caspase inhibitor Figure 9. It is unlikely that the Cullin-3–based complex regulates caspases at the mRNA level  , because transcripts of effector caspase drice and initiator caspase dronc are present in cul3 mutant testes Figure S5.In this system  , canonical apoptotic proteins are used to dramatically remodel cell structure by eliminating many organelles and the majority of cytoplasm 12 ,50. In the present study  , we show a physiological requirement of a cullin-3–based E3-ubiqutin ligase complex for caspase activation and sperm differentiation in Drosophila.We performed an unbiased screen for mRNAs present in thalamic axons  , recovered β-catenin transcripts at high frequency and identified other transcripts in thalamic axons. Local translation of mRNAs in growth cones is a well established mechanism to facilitate rapid changes in growth cone protein levels in response to guidance cues including Netrin-1 so we hypothesised that thalamic axons might contain β-catenin mRNA 44-56.DA axons are steered dorsally by interaction of the repulsive cue UNC-6 netrin with receptors  , UNC-40 DCC and UNC-5  , and the CLR-1 receptor tyrosine phosphatase 90 ,91. Embryonic DA motor neurons extend commissures to innervate muscles on the dorsal side whereas larval VA motor axons are retained in the ventral nerve cord.Thalamic axons were exposed to Netrin-1 for various time intervals 10 minutes  , 1 hour  , or 24 hours and processed for β-catenin immunofluorescence. Cultures were exposed to Netrin-1 400 ng/ml  , a concentration that has previously been shown to stimulate thalamic axon growth 14.However  , subsequent work from the same group has shown that loss of Cajal bands as a result of Drp2 ablation causes focal hypermyelination and concomitant demyelination 20. Ablation of the Schwann cell protein Periaxin disrupts Cajal bands and is also associated with reduced longitudinal growth of Schwann cells 19.The LUSTR1 cDNA codes for a G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor also termed GPR107 or KIAA1624  , with three AtoG discrepancies located within an alternatively spliced AluJo-derived exon that leads to the in-frame insertion of 29 amino acids between transmembrane regions V and VI of the protein see Figure 1A. Interestingly  , editing levels at all positions were significantly different in human brain 19%–58% compared to lung less than 5%  , suggesting a tissue-specific regulation of editing see Figure 1B.EBs were left untreated control  , solid line or incubated with 100 ng/ml of recombinant sFRP-1 secreted frizzled-related protein-1; dashed line from days 3 to 6. b Wnt pathway activity in differentiating mESCs stably transfected with the TOP-FLASH reporter construct.To test this  , we first analyzed mig-1; unc-6 animals  , and found that they showed comparable penetrance of missing and misplaced PLM branch to that in the unc-6 and mig-1 single mutants  , respectively Fig 7A and 7D. This observation suggests that Wnts and ventrally-derived Netrin act orthogonally to pattern the PLM branch  , with Wnts instructing the A-P position of the branch and Netrin promoting its growth along the D-V axis.For Netrin-1 free cultures  , 40% of the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cultures were then exposed to Netrin-1 by replacing 40% of the culture medium with fresh culture medium supplemented with Netrin-1 R&D Systems to give a final concentration of 400 ng/ml.Interestingly  , forced expression of sFRP-1 in 3T3-L1 cells stimulates preadipocyte differentiation  , and sFRP-1-deficient male mice have diminished body fat 30 ,31. Of note  , both secreted frizzled-related proteins sFRP 1 and 5  , two extracellular inhibitors of the Wnt pathway  , are strongly upregulated by CD2314 at day 6  , suggesting that an inhibition of the Wnt pathway activity  , besides its demonstrated role in adipocyte terminal differentiation  , might also be involved in the early steps of adipogenesis Figure 4a.Finally  , the SCF ligase and the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway regulate dendrite pruning in ddaC neurons at least in part by promoting local caspase activation in the dendrites. We demonstrate that the Cul1-based SCF E3 ligase complex facilitates ddaC dendrite pruning primarily through inactivation of the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway.Supporting this hypothesis  , caspase-9 exists predominantly as a monomer in solution and exhibits a basal level of catalytic activity 19 ,22. However  , this initial explanation of the induced proximity model contained little mechanistic information until it was enhanced by the proposition that the oligomeric complex such as the apoptosome serves to activate the monomeric initiator caspases through induced dimerization via their intrinsic dimerization interface 19–21.Microarray analysis revealed that in sea urchin six3 is a positive regulator of the expression of foxQ2  , foxJ1  , and frizzled 5/8
11  , genes that are also expressed at the aboral pole of Nematostella downstream of NvSix3/6 Figures 1 and 3; 55 and unpublished data. In embryos injected with a six3 morpholino  , the ectodermal thickening does not occur and neither the apical organ nor the neurons develop 11.For each condition values represent means for n = 84-95 growth cones randomly selected from 3 independent cultures each including thalamic tissue from several embryos Students t-test p values for ± Netrin-1 comparion indicated above histogram bars at each time-point. F Growth cone β-catenin staining pixel intensity measured after 10 minutes  , 1 hour  , or 24 hours exposure to Netrin-1 expressed relative to untreated controls.The development of the thalamus and its connections relies on intercellular communication mediated by secreted signalling proteins including Wnt  , Slit  , and Netrin proteins 8-19. In mice axons grow from the thalamus into the ventral telencephalon at around embryonic day E12-13 and then on to the cerebral cortex which they first reach at around E13-14 1-7.Secreted Wnt glycoproteins CWN-1  , EGL-20 and CWN-2 are marked in orange and purple  , respectively  , which form discrete graded distribution along the anterior-posterior axis to regulate the stereotyped PLM branching pattern. Schematic diagram depicting that Wnt and Netrin pathways orthogonally regulate PLM neurite branching.Od-netrin was first detected in a few notochord precursors at the neurula stage Additional file 5  , panel H; at the mid-tailbud/early hatchling stage and Stage 1  , notochord expression was distinctively discontinuous Figure. Proteins of the Netrin family are diffusible chemoattractants required for axon guidance in a wide variety of animals 53.The signal is then transduced through a receptor-adaptor complex comprising Imd itself homologous to the mammalian Receptor Interacting Protein RIP  , minus the kinase domain 6  , dFADD FAS-associated death domain protein homologue 7  , 8 and the caspase-8 homologue Dredd death-related Ced-3/Nedd2-like protein 9. It is assumed that fragments of peptidoglycan released by these bacteria bind the peptidoglycan recognition proteins LC or LE at the cell surface or the cytosol respectively leading to their multimerization 5.
