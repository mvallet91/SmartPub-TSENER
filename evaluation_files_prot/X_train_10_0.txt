In addition  , genes with either established or likely roles in the G-protein coupled signaling pathways that modulate ACh release from these motor neurons dop-1  , pkc-1  , kin-2  , gar2  , rgs-1  , rgs-6  , gpc-2 are common to both enriched datasets 5 ,81. ACh signaling depends on the synaptic vesicle cycle and genes with key roles in this mechanism are elevated in both datasets: these include unc-18  , snt-1 syntaxin  , snn-1 synapsin  , ric-4 SNAP-25  , sng-1 synaptogyrin  , unc-2 calcium channel  , rab-3  , and unc-11 clathrin component.Clearly  , however  , these two relations are not independent of each other. Where derives_from links classes of continuants  , preceded_by links classes of processes.This problem is resolved in the treatment of derivation and transformation below  , and has been correspondingly corrected in versions 1.14 and later of the Cell Ontology. An example is provided by the simultaneous use in OBO's Cell Ontology of both derives_from and develops_from while no clear distinction is drawn between the two 11.d Analysis of the mRNA level of IFNγ and granzyme-B Gran B in lung samples of mice bearing 4T1/RFP tumors or 4T1/TGF-β1 tumors. c Analysis of IFNγ+ specific CD8+ cell percentage in lymphocytes purified from the spleen of mice bearing 4T1/RFP tumors or 4T1/TGF-β1 tumors.As predicted from the similarity in crystal structures  , synaptobrevin is unable to displace tomosyn from the tomosyn SNARE complex and vice versa  , without prior NSF disassembly 
11. Consistent with these properties  , the crystal structure of the core tomosyn SNARE complex reveals a four-alpha helical arrangement between the SNARE domains of tomosyn  , SNAP-25  , and syntaxin that is similar to the structure of the synaptobrevin-containing SNARE complex 
11.Consistent with these properties  , the crystal structure of the core tomosyn SNARE complex reveals a four-alpha helical arrangement between the SNARE domains of tomosyn  , SNAP-25  , and syntaxin that is similar to the structure of the synaptobrevin-containing SNARE complex 
11. The biophysical properties of the tomosyn SNARE complex resemble those of the SNARE complex: both form at similar rates  , have strong hysteresis during folding/unfolding transitions  , exhibit alpha helicity  , and are disassembled by NSF 
10.The specificity of the 2D3-IP protocol to enrich for slipped-DNAs was supported by the inability to detect DNAs derived from a control region lamin B2 that is devoid of unusual structure forming DNA sequence motifs Fig. S3A – indicating that the 2D3 antibody could not detect any slipped-DNAs at either of the non-expanded alleles.In addition  , the mRNA levels of effector molecules such as IFNγ and granzyme-B in the lungs were reduced after tumor injection P <0.001 Fig. 4a–c.An example is provided by the simultaneous use in OBO's Cell Ontology of both derives_from and develops_from while no clear distinction is drawn between the two 11. Another type of problem turns on the failure to distinguish relational expressions which  , though closely related in meaning  , are revealed to be crucially distinct when explicated in the formally precise way that is demanded by computer implementations.However  , contrary to previous results with traditional antidepressants 2 weeks of treatment 11  , here we did not find major changes in the expression of syntaxin-1 after 3 weeks of treatment with agomelatine or venlafaxine. These data are in line with our previous results showing that traditional antidepressant-induced reduction of glutamate release is accounted for by changes in protein-protein interactions regulating the assembly of the SNARE complex 11  , and by reduction of complex accumulation in presynaptic membranes 13.Where derives_from links classes of continuants  , preceded_by links classes of processes. An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development not however death preceded_by aging.Derivation as a relation between instances. Thus we will have axioms to the effect that from c derives_from c1 we can infer that c and c1 are not identical and that there is some instant of time t such that c1 exists only prior to and c only subsequent to t. We will also be able to infer that the spatial region occupied by c as it begins to exist at t overlaps with the spatial region occupied by c1 as it ceases to exist in the same instant.Because the same result was obtained with both drugs  , we suggest that the difference from other antidepressants is probably due to the different timing of drug-treatment 3 vs 2 weeks. However  , contrary to previous results with traditional antidepressants 2 weeks of treatment 11  , here we did not find major changes in the expression of syntaxin-1 after 3 weeks of treatment with agomelatine or venlafaxine.ACh signaling depends on the synaptic vesicle cycle and genes with key roles in this mechanism are elevated in both datasets: these include unc-18  , snt-1 syntaxin  , snn-1 synapsin  , ric-4 SNAP-25  , sng-1 synaptogyrin  , unc-2 calcium channel  , rab-3  , and unc-11 clathrin component. In addition to these gene families  , several others are enriched in both embryonic and larval A-class motor neurons Additional data file 19.
