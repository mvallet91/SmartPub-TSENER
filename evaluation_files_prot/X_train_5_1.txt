Indeed  , miR-378 appears to target nephronectin  , which is a positive regulator of osteoblastic differentiation. A role of decreased miR-378 expression in osteogenesis in the osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 has been suggested recently 29.Very recently  , Gerin and co-workers 30 identified miR-378/378* as positive regulators of lipogenesis. Indeed  , miR-378 appears to target nephronectin  , which is a positive regulator of osteoblastic differentiation.The methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 was shown to interact with the lamin B receptor and may connect DNA methylation with nuclear architecture
60. Some studies have shown that nuclear architecture could be altered during normal aging beyond just modifications connected with premature aging syndromes
59.As Xist seems to interact directly with the lamin B receptor LBR  , a protein mediating the interaction between chromatin and lamin B 21  , 23  , this interaction could be a necessary intermediate in keeping the Xi in the proximity of the nuclear envelope  , where heterochromatin is tethered  , thereby reinforcing or stabilizing the Xi conformation and gene silencing 24 Table 1. Such conformation changes might explain the slightly higher rate of reactivation of X-linked genes in Xist-deficient cells observed by the Jaenisch group in the maintenance phase of XCI  , which is otherwise thought to be Xist independent 22.21 have critically shed light on the previously elusive Xist-interacting proteins and how Xist might both establish gene silencing by Hdac3-mediated histone deacetylation and reinforce gene silencing by tethering the inactive X chromosome to the nuclear periphery through interaction with the lamin B receptor LBR and topoisomerase remodeling of the Xi. 44 and Minajigi et al.Similar to our findings  , whole-genome bisulfite sequencing showed that approximately 36% of identified age-associated  , differentially methylated regions were within LADs
44. The methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 was shown to interact with the lamin B receptor and may connect DNA methylation with nuclear architecture
60.Interestingly  , Splinter et al. As Xist seems to interact directly with the lamin B receptor LBR  , a protein mediating the interaction between chromatin and lamin B 21  , 23  , this interaction could be a necessary intermediate in keeping the Xi in the proximity of the nuclear envelope  , where heterochromatin is tethered  , thereby reinforcing or stabilizing the Xi conformation and gene silencing 24 Table 1.
