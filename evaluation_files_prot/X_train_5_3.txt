Three of these are expressed in venom gland alone and are classified as probable platypus venom toxins. For example  , we identified seven genes encoding peptides with homology to spider venom alpha-latrotoxin  , a neurotoxin also containing ankyrin repeats  , which causes a massive release of neurotransmitters on contact with vertebrate neurones reviewed in 45.To determine whether aging alters expression of NLRP1 inflammasome components  , protein lysates of young and aged hippocampi were analyzed for levels of inflammatory caspases and key inflammasome proteins Figure 2. Upon inflammasome activation caspase-1 is cleaved into active fragments that process pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into active IL-1β and IL-18 14.In B  , sections were stained with antibodies to the cleaved fragment of caspase 3 ID number: 12367 and 14  , 4′ ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole DAPI to reveal apoptotic cells red color and cell nuclei blue color  , respectively. B  , C Example B; scale bar  , 100 µm and quantification C of apoptotic cells found in the epidermis of mice of the indicated genotypes 24 h upon the application of DMBA n = 4.Upon inflammasome activation caspase-1 is cleaved into active fragments that process pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into active IL-1β and IL-18 14. The NLRP1 inflammasome in neurons constitutes a multiprotein complex consisting of caspase-1  , caspase-11  , apoptosis-associated-speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain ASC  , NLRP1  , P2X7  , pannexin-1 and XIAP 4.At 10 and 14 dpf  , neither wild-type nor fgf24 mutant gonads displayed appreciable apoptosis in either SGCs or germ cells Fig 6A–6C’; S3A–S3B’ Fig. We assessed the extent of apoptosis by staining for Cleaved caspase 3 Cc3 and by performing a TUNEL assay.A 4T1 tumors from mice treated for 14 days with the inhibitors described in Figure 1C were harvested  , and frozen sections were stained for proliferation phospho-histone H3; blue  , apoptosis cleaved caspase 3; red and endothelial cells CD31; green. Analyses of 4T1 tumors and lung metastases in mice treated with dovitinib  , NVP-BEZ235 or the combination.A Frozen sections from 4T1 tumors harvested after 14 days of treatment as described in Figure 5A were stained for proliferation phospho-histone H3; blue  , apoptosis cleaved caspase 3; red and endothelial cells CD31; green. Analysis of 4T1 tumors from mice treated with AEE788 + dovitinib.For example  , we identified seven genes encoding peptides with homology to spider venom alpha-latrotoxin  , a neurotoxin also containing ankyrin repeats  , which causes a massive release of neurotransmitters on contact with vertebrate neurones reviewed in 45. Genes encoding proteins with homology to invertebrate venom toxins were also found.
