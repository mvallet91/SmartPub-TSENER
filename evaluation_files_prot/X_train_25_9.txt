According to previous reports and the crystal structure of the Thermotoga maritima Tma enzyme 50  , treatment of the PCR products with endonuclease V was expected to result in hydrolysis of the second phosphodiester bond 3′ to dI 51. In order to enable cloning  , the 5′ primer ends comprise four additional nucleotides with a deoxyinosine residue at the third position compare Figure 1.DNA extracted at intervals after HO cutting was split. A strain carrying an HMLα donor yXW2  , thus able to repair the DSB at MAT by gene conversion  , was treated with 2% galactose to induce HO endonuclease and then with 2% glucose after 1 h to repress further HO expression.The annealed oligonucleotide corresponding to the sgRNA sequence was inserted into the CRISPR/Cas9 vector  , expressing both sgRNA and Cas9-endonuclease in mammalian cells 4. 1  , because exon 7 is included in the major isoforms 16.Following hybridization  , non-specifically bound nucleotides were removed by washing and specifically bound target detected using a GeneChip Hybridization  , Wash and Stain kit and a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 Affymetrix. The cDNA was then fragmented by uracil DNA glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidic endonuclease 1 and biotin-labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase using the GeneChip WT Terminal labeling kit Affymetrix.2 Then  , genomic DNA fragments are circularized using thermostable DNA ligase and Taq DNA polymerase for 5' editing. b Specific preparation steps: 1 genomic DNA is digested using MseI restriction endonuclease.Two observations argue against the possibility that we have overlooked any large genomic rearrangements  , however: 1 A large inversion present in the wMelPop genome was successfully identified in our mapping analyses  , despite being flanked by repeats of moderate length  , and 2 an earlier physical and genetic map of wMelPop based on restriction endonuclease digestion identified that same inversion as the only large-scale disruption of collinearity between wMelPop and wMel Sun et al. If long repeats form the breakpoints of structural rearrangements  , these events might not be detected.Genomic DNA was isolated from comparable leaves before and after induction then analyzed to determine whether the PB1 endonucleases function in plants Figure 2B  , 2C  , and Additional file 1. Western blot analyses confirmed that the endonuclease was not expressed at detectable levels prior to heat shock  , with expression strongly induced by the two-hour heat shock data not shown.Thus  , one of several hallmarks of APOBEC3B mutagenesis is C-to-T transition mutations within specific local DNA sequence contexts based on the intrinsic biochemical nature of the deaminase itself elaborated below. Uracil in DNA is a pre-mutagenic lesion because DNA polymerases ‘read’ it as thymine and pair it properly through two hydrogen bonds to adenine during DNA replication Figure 2b.Streptavidin was bound to biotinylated DNA by incubating 50 nM DNA with 1 μM streptavidin NEB at room temperature in the endonuclease reaction buffer for 15 min immediately prior to use. Excess nucleotide was removed using a P-30 spin column Bio-Rad according to the manufacturer’s instructions.A short stretch of the genomic region ~270–280 bp flanking the apol1 gRNA target site was PCR amplified from the genomic DNA Fwd: TGTGTGAAGGATGCATTTGTT  , Rev: TGGGATAATGTATGGGAGAATG. For T7 endonuclease I assay  , genomic DNA was prepared from 1 dpf embryos as described 58.Similar examples of a Rte-1-like HGT events have been reported from plants to fish and from arthropods to reptiles 20. Rte-1 encodes an endonuclease and a reverse transcriptase enclosed by target site duplication sequences at the 5' and 3' end.SSA mediates annealing between two ssDNA ends containing homologous or microhomologous repeats  , whereas the 3′ overhanging ends of the processed DSBs are trimmed by XPF-ERCC1 endonuclease 51  , depriving the APOBEC editing enzymes from a single strand substrate for cytidine deamination Additional file 1: Figure S6b. Since a high frequency of microhomologies was observed in all novel breakpoints 9  , we reasoned that a putative alternative repair route could be single strand annealing SSA.We replaced the mouse Cx47 coding region by the mutated mCx47M282T one  , an internal ribosome entry site IRES followed by the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase β-gal coding DNA LacZ  , preceded by a nuclear localization sequence and a frt-site-flanked neomycin selection cassette by homologous recombination in HM-1 embryonic stem cells 26 Figure 1A. Codon 282 was mutated to cause a methionine residue to threonine transition by T to C exchange at nucleotide 845 of the mCx47 coding region which in addition resulted in a recognition site 5′-N5GAGACG-3′ of the restriction endonuclease BsmBI.Primer extension analyses of both cellular RNA from Naegleria and in vitro transcribed intron RNA 7 ,28 are consistent with the formation of a tiny lariat cap structure between nucleotide 1 and 3 of the messenger  , as recently reported in the related DiGIR1 ribozyme 30. The expression of the NaHEG is dependent on a functional NaGIR1 ribozyme  , which defines the 5' end of the homing endonuclease mRNA by internal processing and modification of the excised Nae.S516 intron 7 ,28 ,29.The SVA insertion within SUZ12P intron 8 is likely to have been initiated by the L1 endonuclease L1-EN  , which will have introduced a nick at the consensus cleavage site 5′-CTTT/A-3′. The dotted lines indicate the approximately 1-Mb distance between these two regions.Other than the heat shock elements  , no statistically significant motifs were associated with the promoters of these genes. The Cdc2 cluster contains several interesting cell cycle genes  , including cdc2 itself; SPBC1861.01c and abp2  , which code for AT hook proteins thought to bind centromeric DNA and ARS DNA  , respectively;res1  , a key component of the MBF transcription factor; sds22  , a protein phosphatase regulatory subunit known to be involved in the cell cycle; ash2  , a member of the SET1 complex  , and involved in lysine methylation of histone H3; alp1  , a tubulin-specific chaperone; SPCC18.03  , a putative transcriptional regulator; pkl1  , a kinesin-like protein of the Kar3 family; and other genes.Genomic DNA was extracted from each blastocyst and used for PCR amplification of the target region and genotyping by XbaI or T7 endonuclease I T7EI. b: In vitro blastocyst assay: zygotes microinjected with Cas9 mRNA and sgRosa26-1 RNA were cultured for 4 days to blastocysts.Antibodies to the following proteins were obtained commercially: PCNA monoclonal  , sc-25280  , XRCC1 polyclonal  , sc-11429  , Chk1 polyclonal  , sc-7898  , Chk2 polyclonal  , sc-9064  , p21 monoclonal  , sc-6246  , pRb monoclonal  , sc-103  , phospho-Chk1 polyclonal  , sc-17922R  , Cdc25A polyclonal  , sc-7157  , MDM2 monoclonal  , sc-5304  , p53 monoclonal  , sc-126  , E2F1 monoclonal  , sc-251  , and actin polyclonal  , sc-1616 from Santa Cruz Biotech Santa Cruz  , CA  , USA; ataxia telangiectasia mutated ATM; polyclonal  , NB 100-104  , apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 APE1; monoclonal  , NB 100-116 from Novus Biologicals Littleton  , CO  , USA; phospho-Chk2 polyclonal  , 2661  , and phospho-p53 sampler kit  , #9919 antibodies from Cell Signaling Boston  , MA  , USA; phospho-ATM polyclonal  , ab2888 and phospho-DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs; polyclonal  , ab18192 from Abcam Cambridge  , MA  , USA; PNK monoclonal  , MAB005 from CytoStore Calgary  , AB  , Canada; epithelial specific antigen FITC-labeled monoclonal  , MM-1014 from Immunobiosciences Raleigh  , NC  , USA. For western blotting and immunohistochemistry standard protocols currently applied to breast stem cells were used 26 ,27.ACC  , acetyl coA carboxylase; MCD  , malonyl coA decarboxylase; FABP  , fatty acid binding protein; FATP  , fatty acid transport protein; ACSL  , acyl coA synthase long chain 1; HSL  , hormone sensitive lipase; ATGL  , adipose triglyceride lipase; ACBP  , acylcoA binding protein; CPT  , Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase. Genes whose expression is reduced in Hand1 overexpressing hearts are in red in A.Other members of this interacting complex  , MKK-4 MAP kinase kinase and JNK-1 Jun kinase are also required for maintaining normal synaptic structure 69 ,70. For example  , the JIP3/JSAP1 JNK scaffolding protein  , UNC-16  , interacts with KLC-2 kinesin light chain to regulate vesicular transport in neurons 68.The resultant nick  , 5′ or 3′ to the mismatch  , directs excision and resynthesis steps that remove the misincorporated DNA 1. MutH functions as a latent endonuclease that nicks the newly replicated and undermethylated DNA strand up to several kilobases away from the mismatch.In support of the latter  , deletion of JNK and JNK kinase results in the mislocalization of synaptic vesicle components in C. elegans 48  , although this could be due to a requirement of JNK to regulate microtubule dynamics 49. This implies that the subcellular localization of the JNK signaling complex in the neuron may be regulated by vesicular axonal transport or conversely that kinesin motor activity during axonal transport may itself be regulated via the JNK signaling pathway.As the human FAH gene contains 14 exons and is 35 kb long  , a single zinc finger–based homologous recombination approach cannot be used to correct the different mutations in newborns with tyrosinemia type I  , unless new targeting strategies are designed for each new mutation. The use of tailored zinc fingers attached to an endonuclease for site-specific double-strand breaks substantially increases the efficiency of recombination  , but the flanking regions of the repair constructs are only 0.5–1 kbp long  , and therefore specific zinc fingers need to be designed for each targeted locus 37.There  , the error-prone repair of double-strand breaks by non-homologous end joining results in nucleotide deletions and insertions  , which can lead to gene inactivation. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR-associated RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 can be utilized in eukaryotic cells to introduce double-strand breaks at specific genomic sequences 1  , 2.A subset of ERI class endogenous siRNAs  , found in oocytes and embryos  , associates with the Argonaute ERGO-1  , whereas a sperm-specific class associates with the Argonautes ALG-3 and ALG-4 18–20. The 26G siRNAs and the corresponding downstream 22G siRNAs  , collectively called the ‘ERI’ class of siRNAs  , all depend on a protein complex that includes the 3′-5′ exonuclease ERI-1  , the RdRP RRF-3  , the endonuclease DCR-1/ERI-4  , and the dsRNA binding protein RDE-4 22–24.Nuclei were harvested after 0 or 30 min of TNFα stimulation  , cross-linked in 1% paraformaldehyde PFA; Electron Microscopy Science  , Munich  , Germany  , and processed as described 21 using ApoI as the primary restriction endonuclease. Data permutation is then used to determine a threshold of <0.01 false discovery rate FDR; windows exceeding this threshold are scored as interacting.The construct was injected into embryos by Rainbow Transgenic Flies  , Inc. Transformants were crossed to flies carrying hs-I-SceI and hs-Flp and progeny were heat shocked 37°C for 1 hour 48–72 hours AEL. Genomic fragments upstream and downstream of the sano ORF were amplified by PCR and cloned into pW25  , which carries white  , the recognition site for I-SceI endonuclease  , and FRT sites.It is important to note that one nick is sufficient to convert closed circular substrate to nicked product  , and because nicking occurs in random locations on the plasmid  , quantifying the number and location of nicks is not feasible. We suggest that there is a critical polymer length on the order of 1 kb; S5B Fig needed to activate the endonuclease activity that is achieved more readily on a circular substrate where all initiating sites are equivalent.C RTPCR of mRNA from 2-mo-old adult XMLC2-Hand1 mice following doxycycline induction for 2 wk  , showing changes in expression of RNA encoding fatty acid metabolising proteins relative to control non-up-regulating mice *p<0.05  , **p<0.005  , two-tailed t test  , n = 4 each group. ACC  , acetyl coA carboxylase; MCD  , malonyl coA decarboxylase; FABP  , fatty acid binding protein; FATP  , fatty acid transport protein; ACSL  , acyl coA synthase long chain 1; HSL  , hormone sensitive lipase; ATGL  , adipose triglyceride lipase; ACBP  , acylcoA binding protein; CPT  , Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase.Strains BI-1 to -5 are considered 'historic' and were isolated between 1988 and 1995. These isolates were typed by restriction endonuclease analysis as BI  , which is equivalent to PCR-ribotype 027; however  , each isolate represents a unique small variation found in the BI restriction endonuclease analysis patterns.Subsequently  , the DNA is treated with uracil DNA glycosidase UNG and usually either T4 endonuclease 5 or DNA glycosylase-lyase endo VIII commercially available as a mix with UNG as the so-called USER™ enzyme from New England Biolabs  , which releases the sequence upstream from the dU's and allows pairing between exposed  , compatible ends and these reactions define the term "uracil-excision" as it is used here. In the technique  , compatible single stranded DNA overhangs are created by substituting selected deoxy thymidine dT nucleotides with deoxy uridine nucleotides dU Figure 1.Cytoplasmic dynein  , however  , is a larger and more complex microtubule motor  , comprising two dynein heavy chain Dhc motor subunits and various intermediate  , light intermediate  , and light chain Dlc subunits Figure 1 reviewed in 7. In contrast to kinesin  , the cytoplasmic dynein family in mammals is much smaller  , consisting of only two members.We provide detailed description including DNA sequences and corresponding molecular biology of targeted sequencing library preparation assay in Additional File 1. This relaxes the criteria for designing capture oligonucleotides  , since only one of the two ends requires a specific restriction endonuclease site.By analyzing multiple grids and multiple locations on these grids  , we observed the following: 1 Circular DNA alone displays different degrees of supercoiling but no higher-order structures Fig 5A  , and Mlh1-Mlh3 in the absence of DNA did not show any distinct structures Fig 5B. To directly visualize whether multiple Mlh1-Mlh3 molecules bound to DNA are critical for Mlh1-Mlh3 nicking activity  , we performed negative staining electron microscopy experiments on samples containing the following mixtures: circular DNA alone Fig 5A; 300 nM Mlh1-Mlh3 alone Fig 5B; 30 nM Mlh1-Mlh3 in the presence of DNA  , which confers suboptimal nicking activity Figs 2A  , 2B and 5C; and 300 nM Mlh1-Mlh3 in the presence of DNA  , which confers robust endonuclease activity on circular DNA Figs 1A  , 2B and 5D.The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR-associated RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 can be utilized in eukaryotic cells to introduce double-strand breaks at specific genomic sequences 1  , 2. While several web services for the gene-by-gene design of sgRNAs have been developed 18–22  , integrated and flexible bioinformatics workflows for the design of custom sgRNA libraries are currently lacking.After treatment with 5 u of Tma endonuclease V  , a ligation reaction with dephosphorylated pUC19 digested with AatII and PstI was set up using a molar insert to vector ratio of 7:1. A total of 31 cycles were used for Taq polymerase-based amplification.Donors were crossed to the line containing heat-shock-inducible FLP recombinase and I-SceI endonuclease transgenes 29 and larvae were heat shocked for 1 h at 37°C on days 3 and 4 of development. pP{WO2-dsx-GAL4} transgenics Rainbow Transgenic Flies  , Inc. were made as described above and four independent integrant lines were isolated to serve as donors of the dsx DNA substrate for homologous recombination 29.Polyclonal anti-Ku80 antibody was a gift from Dr. Susan Lees-Miller University of Calgary  , Calgary  , AB  , Canada  , antibody to polymerase-β was a gift from Dr. Sam Wilson National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  , Research Triangle Park  , NC  , USA  , and monoclonal antibody to ING1 was kindly provided by Dr. Karl Riabowol University of Calgary  , Calgary  , AB  , Canada. Antibodies to the following proteins were obtained commercially: PCNA monoclonal  , sc-25280  , XRCC1 polyclonal  , sc-11429  , Chk1 polyclonal  , sc-7898  , Chk2 polyclonal  , sc-9064  , p21 monoclonal  , sc-6246  , pRb monoclonal  , sc-103  , phospho-Chk1 polyclonal  , sc-17922R  , Cdc25A polyclonal  , sc-7157  , MDM2 monoclonal  , sc-5304  , p53 monoclonal  , sc-126  , E2F1 monoclonal  , sc-251  , and actin polyclonal  , sc-1616 from Santa Cruz Biotech Santa Cruz  , CA  , USA; ataxia telangiectasia mutated ATM; polyclonal  , NB 100-104  , apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 APE1; monoclonal  , NB 100-116 from Novus Biologicals Littleton  , CO  , USA; phospho-Chk2 polyclonal  , 2661  , and phospho-p53 sampler kit  , #9919 antibodies from Cell Signaling Boston  , MA  , USA; phospho-ATM polyclonal  , ab2888 and phospho-DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs; polyclonal  , ab18192 from Abcam Cambridge  , MA  , USA; PNK monoclonal  , MAB005 from CytoStore Calgary  , AB  , Canada; epithelial specific antigen FITC-labeled monoclonal  , MM-1014 from Immunobiosciences Raleigh  , NC  , USA.Without EndoV treatment  , transformation of the corresponding ligation reaction resulted in only 10 colonies  , demonstrating that deoxyinosine 3′ endonuclease activity is a strict requirement for the cloning strategy to work. With 816 cfu  , increasing the molar insert to vector fragment ratio to 10:1 did not result in a higher number of transformants.All prototrophic S. cerevisiae deletion mutants were constructed in the haploid  , CEN.PK113-7D Mata MAL2-8SUC2 background with the homolog flanking region approach 17 Table 1. The reference strain was CEN.PK 113-7D with a deletion of the switching endonuclease  , which was shown to be phenotypically neutral in chemostat competition experiments 51 and is commonly used as reference 52 ,53.Then  , nuclei were incubated for 3 minutes at 37 °C in the same lysis buffer with 1 mM CaCl2 and with limiting concentrations of the DNA endonuclease deoxyribonuclease I DNase I. In brief  , nuclei were extracted in lysis buffer 15 mM Tris‐HCl  , 15 mM NaCl  , 60 mM KCl  , 1 mM EDTA  , 0.5 mM EGTA  , 0.5 mM spermidine by incubating for 10 minutes on ice.DNA-protein interactions of endonucleases and their cleavage of distinct DNA substrates. Digests were conducted with 0  , 0.007  , 0.015  , 0.031  , 0.062  , 0.125  , 0.25  , 0.5  , 1  , 2 μM endonuclease.Furthermore  , long polyT tracts were noted at the integration sites; such tracts also represent hallmarks of L1-mediated TPRT Figures S9 and S15 in Additional file 1. The SVA elements we identified within SUZ12P intron 8 most likely integrated via TPRT since L1 endonuclease cleavage sites 5′-CTTT/A-3′ were detected at the corresponding integration sites within SUZ12P intron 8 Figures S16 and S17 in Additional file 1.RNase A is a small protein of 124 amino acids that contains 4 disulfide bridges 21 and has been extensively used as a model to study the effects of disulfide bonds on protein refolding. The efficiency of the MESNA/diMESNA redox couple in protein refolding was tested using bovine pancreatic Ribonuclease A RNase A.Both reactions were carried out under predefined optimal reaction conditions. The amount of enzyme required to cut 1 μg of phage φ80vir DNA during 1 h at 37°C has been taken as 1 AU of the RM.Eco29kI restriction endonuclease activity.The use of tailored zinc fingers attached to an endonuclease for site-specific double-strand breaks substantially increases the efficiency of recombination  , but the flanking regions of the repair constructs are only 0.5–1 kbp long  , and therefore specific zinc fingers need to be designed for each targeted locus 37. In addition  , this approach is rather inefficient and cannot be applied to human ES or iPS cells.The pDsRed-ISceI plasmid Figure 1B was created by inserting an 18 bp recognition site for I-SceI endonuclease between the BglII and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′ end of the promoterless DsRed gene in the pDsRed-Express-1 plasmid Clontech. The pGFP-ISceI plasmid was generated from the pEJ5-GFP plasmid by deletion of the puromycin-resistance puro gene following NHEJ between the two I-SceI sites.The efficiency of the MESNA/diMESNA redox couple in protein refolding was tested using bovine pancreatic Ribonuclease A RNase A. A small peak corresponding to hydrolyzed GFP was observed after 10 h incubation at RT  , but the amount of hydrolysis is significantly reduced compared to the incubation with glutathione redox buffer.The gels were stained by ethidium bromide and imaged by LAS-3000 mini Fujifilm with a UV transilluminator. These products were treated with T7 endonuclease I New England Biolabs at 37 °C for 1 h. The digested DNA fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.GA can be further oxidized to 5-KGA or 2-keto-D-gluconate 2-KGA by PQQ-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase SLDH  , GOX0854-0855 or FAD-dependent gluconate 2-dehydrogenase GA2DH  , GOX1230-1232  , which transfer electrons from glucose to the respiratory chain ubiquinone and then to terminal ubiquinol oxidases to generate the proton motive force 10  , 14. The membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase mGDH  , GOX0265  , a quinoprotein containing pyrroloquinoline quinone PQQ  , oxidizes D-glucose to D-glucono-δ-lactone  , which is subsequently converted to gluconic acid GA spontaneously or by gluconolactonase 11–13.The template was degraded using 10 units of DpnI restriction endonuclease at 37°C for at least 2 h. After transformation of competent E. coli  , recombinant plasmids were isolated and their sequence verified. The thermocycling program used was 94°C for 1 min  , followed by 18 cycles of 94°C for 1 min  , 55°C for 1 min  , 72°C for 10 min and a final extension cycle of 72°C for 10 min.For each oligonucleotide  , the complementary flank sequences  , referred to as capture arms  , hybridize to the target genomic DNA molecule and mediate the selective circularization of single stranded target DNA Figure 1a and 1b. Once the genomic DNA has been fragmented with a specific restriction endonuclease such as MseI  , the capture oligonucleotide pools and genomic DNA are incubated together in a single reaction volume Figure 1.Recently  , it was shown that cells deficient in BRCA1 and 53BP1 relied on Rad52-dependent SSA to survive 52. SSA mediates annealing between two ssDNA ends containing homologous or microhomologous repeats  , whereas the 3′ overhanging ends of the processed DSBs are trimmed by XPF-ERCC1 endonuclease 51  , depriving the APOBEC editing enzymes from a single strand substrate for cytidine deamination Additional file 1: Figure S6b.One prominent example is the homing drive  , in which the drive allele contains an endonuclease gene that targets a specific site in the genome for cleavage and then inserts itself into that site via homology-directed repair HDR. Gene drive systems promise a mechanism for rapidly spreading alleles in a population through super-Mendelian inheritance 1–5.We found that at birth  , expression of several genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid and acylcarnitine metabolism are up-regulated in the wild-type heart at p0.5  , including ACC acetyl coA carboxylase  , MCD malonyl coA decarboxylase  , and CPT isoforms carnitine palmitoyl transferase as previously reported 21–24  , along with FABP fatty acid binding protein  , FATP fatty acid transport protein  , ACSL acyl coA synthase long chain 1  , HSL hormone sensitive lipase  , and ATGL adipose triglyceride lipase Figure 3A ,B. Using RT-PCR  , we found that XMLC2-Hand1 hearts failed to up-regulate a subset of these genes.pK-SV40A was made by cloning a single copy of the SV40 polyA signal amplified by PCR with oligos KJC-SV40A-F1 CATTGATGAGTTTGGACAAACCACA and KJC-SV40A-R1 ACCACATTTGTAGAGGTTTTACTTGCT into pK-A10 opened with XmnI. pKUb was made by cloning nucleotides 3561–4771 of the human UbC gene genbank accession D63791  , which contains the UbC promoter  , non-coding exon 1  , and intron 1  , into pK-SV40A between intact BglII and NheI restriction endonuclease sites.After overnight incubation at 28°C  , single colonies were purified  , and successful recombination was checked by monitoring absence of antibiotic resistance and colony PCR with oligonucleotides ΔpgaC Fw and pgaD Rv. After 1 h of incubation at 28°C  , 100 μl of a 10−2 dilution was plated on LB agar plates containing 500 ng ml-1 anhydrotetracycline  , which induced expression of I-SceI endonuclease.Strains undergoing DSB-induced gene conversion were treated with 2% glucose after 1 h to repress further cutting by HO. Cells were pregrown to a density between 5 × 106 and 1 × 107 cells/ml in YP–lactate medium and HO endonuclease was induced by addition of 2% galactose.Deletion of Kif7 results in a defect in microtubule processing within the primary cilium and misactivation of the Gli family transcription factors GLI 1–3  , the Hh effector molecules 10. Kinesin family member 7 KIF7 is a microtubule interacting protein that functions to regulate Hh signaling by maintaining the architecture of the primary cilium 11  , a complex microtubule based organelle with many signal transduction functions 12 ,13.Another group of genes whose mutants were uniquely sensitive to UV cluster together  , and these genes are involved in three UV repair pathways in the fission yeast  , namely  , postreplication repair  , nucleotide excision repair  , and the UVDE endonuclease-dependent repair pathway 33 ,34. For example  , as highlighted in Figure 4e  , four genes whose mutants showed increased sensitivity to all three types of genotoxins but not to TBZ cluster together and correspond to the genes encoding the proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA-like checkpoint clamp complex Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 9-1-1 complex and the clamp loader protein Rad17 32.Given the advances in structural biology and the advent of synthetic biology  , a strong demand exists to transfer and rearrange a large variety of DNA fragments from different genetic sources in a directed manner. With hundreds of enzymes commercially available today 1  , restriction endonuclease treatment of insert and plasmid vector DNA followed by ligation and transformation into competent E. coli strains presents the standard cloning method in molecular biology.However  , in the oligonucleotide competition endonuclease assay presented here Fig 1  , HJ and +8 loop–containing oligonucleotide substrates acted as very strong competitors relative to homoduplex DNA  , which was an ineffective competing substrate compared to plasmid DNA. Previously  , we showed that Mlh1-Mlh3 has a binding preference for oligonucleotide substrates containing a +8 loop mismatch and a HJ over homoduplex DNA but that the binding affinity differences in buffers used in our endonuclease assay were modest 26 ,27.The cDNA was then fragmented by uracil DNA glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidic endonuclease 1 and biotin-labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase using the GeneChip WT Terminal labeling kit Affymetrix. The quantity and purity of the cRNA and cDNA produced during the first and second rounds were evaluated using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer Nanodrop Technologies.Competent E. coli XL-1 Blue and BL21 strains were used for transformation of the ligation reactions. Following treatment with 5 u E. coli endonuclease V  , purified insert DNA fragments were used in five- or 10-fold molar ratios relative to digested and dephosphorylated pBluescript II KS+.T4 polynucleotide kinase and MalI restriction endonuclease Sibenzyme  , Novosibirsk  , Russia were used. PCR products were purified from 1% agarose gels by the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System Promega  , Madison  , WI.This left 6 IESs  , ranging in size from 2416 to 4154 bp  , with a DDE_3 PFAM accession number 13358 DDE superfamily endonuclease domain characteristic of IS630/Tc1 transposons. Matches at a BLASTX E-value cutoff of 1 were inspected visually to filter out matches with PFAM-A protein domains from Paramecium and matches owing to compositional bias high A+T content.Our study provides evidence that RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation is necessary for elimination of germline DNA in Paramecium  , as is the case in Tetrahymena
1. 7A  , consistent with our observations that the Ezl1 protein acts upstream of the Pgm endonuclease.Some inteins contain a homing endonuclease 5 that has a large specific recognition site 12-40 base pairs. Inteins are intervening polypeptide sequences that are translated as part of a protein 1-4  , and are removed in the maturation of the final protein product.MseI digested genomic DNA was circularized in the presence of a pool of 107 genomic circularization oligonucletides 50 pM/oligo and vector oligonucleotide 10 nM. We digested 1 μg of genomic DNA from NA18507 with MseI restriction endonuclease NEB for 3 hours in 37°C  , followed by a heat inactivation of the enzyme for 20 min in 65°C.Cells were pregrown to a density between 5 × 106 and 1 × 107 cells/ml in YP–lactate medium and HO endonuclease was induced by addition of 2% galactose. 2003.We suggest that there is a critical polymer length on the order of 1 kb; S5B Fig needed to activate the endonuclease activity that is achieved more readily on a circular substrate where all initiating sites are equivalent. We hypothesize that Mlh1-Mlh3 forms a polymer on DNA to activate its endonuclease activity Fig 10A.B  , Normal methylation of LINE1 and IAP retrotransposons in MP  , 0P  , and 00 8.5dpc embryos as established by DNA blot hybridization after cleavage with the methylation-insensitive restriction endonuclease MspI or the methylation sensitive isoschizomer HpaII. Nucleotide positions are reported in reference to the gene transcription start +1.The common steps  , with minor variations  , include 1 generating random cDNA fragments; 2 ligating the cDNA fragments with a double-stranded oligonucleotide that contains an MmeI site; 3 restriction digestion with MmeI; 4 ligating a second oligonucleotide to the digested cDNA fragments to form a double-stranded DNA with a hairpin structure; 5 using a DNA polymerase with strong strand-displacement activity to convert the hairpin DNA into double-stranded DNA; and 6 cloning the double-stranded DNA into an expression vector. These protocols share several common features  , and all "measure" the appropriate length of the hairpin using the type IIS restriction endonuclease MmeI  , which cuts 20/18 nt from its recognition site.One candidate to mediate this coordination is the dynactin complex 38. This suggests that dynein and kinesin are present on the same organelles and their activity is coordinated.The S. acidocaldarius gene was only mildly induced after UV irradiation Table 1. acidocaldarius possesses a gene encoding a UV damage endonuclease saci1096 of the UVDE family 36  , which is UV inducible in Schizosaccharomyces pombe following UV irradiation 37.b Specific preparation steps: 1 genomic DNA is digested using MseI restriction endonuclease. a Overview of the assay.At the lowest concentrations of Cas9-162A 5 ng/μl and sgRosa26-1 2.5 ng/μl RNAs  , Rosa26 alleles from 40 % of the embryos exhibited sequence deletions  , as shown by the presence of XbaI resistant bands  , whereas T7EI assays were less sensitive Fig. PCR products were analyzed for NHEJ repair-associated deletions by digestion with XbaI or the T7 endonuclease I T7EI.The SVA elements we identified within SUZ12P intron 8 most likely integrated via TPRT since L1 endonuclease cleavage sites 5′-CTTT/A-3′ were detected at the corresponding integration sites within SUZ12P intron 8 Figures S16 and S17 in Additional file 1. One of the hallmarks of L1-mediated retrotransposition of SVAs is that they often integrate at DNA sites resembling the L1 endonuclease consensus cleavage sites such as 5′-TTTT/A-3′ or 5′-CTTT/A-3′ 20.The earliest retrospective recorded PCR-ribotype 027 isolate was strain CD196 in 1985  , which is a non-epidemic strain isolated from a single patient with CDI in a Paris hospital 12. For example  , 027 strains are invariably designated as BI by restriction endonuclease analysis  , NAP1 North American pulsotype 1 by pulse field gel electrophoresis  , are exclusively toxinotype III by toxinotyping and are indistinguishable by multi-locus sequence analysis 11.After 1 h of incubation at 28°C  , 100 μl of a 10−2 dilution was plated on LB agar plates containing 500 ng ml-1 anhydrotetracycline  , which induced expression of I-SceI endonuclease. Phosphorylated 80-mer double-stranded DNA derived from oligonucleotides ΔpgaC Fw and ΔpgaC Rv was electroporated into the mutant strain still containing the pWRG730 plasmid.With hundreds of enzymes commercially available today 1  , restriction endonuclease treatment of insert and plasmid vector DNA followed by ligation and transformation into competent E. coli strains presents the standard cloning method in molecular biology. Individual buffer and temperature requirements for endonuclease stability and activity 9 further limit the number of cloning options.The amount of enzyme required to cut 1 μg of phage φ80vir DNA during 1 h at 37°C has been taken as 1 AU of the RM.Eco29kI restriction endonuclease activity. The amount of enzyme required to transfer 1 pmol of 3H-methyl groups to DNA per minute with saturating concentrations of substrates at 37°C has been taken as 1 AU of the RM.Eco29kI DNA methyltransferase activity.In order to create 3′ protruding ends by endonuclease V treatment of the PCR products  , a single deoxyinosine residue was placed at the third position of the primer 5′ end compare Figure 1. All Tm values reported in this study correspond to theoretical values determined for complementary regions by the nearest-neighbor method using OligoCalc 64 with default parameters.Detailed procedures have been described previously 1 ,2. The following amounts of added polymerase correspond to comparable polymerase activity on normal template primer: 5 x 10−4 units/μl Pol I KF USB  , 1 nM PolII  , 2 nM PolIII*  , 4 nM Pol IV or 100 nM Pol V. Finally the reaction product is digested by a restriction endonuclease before PAGE analysis.The locus is bounded by an endonuclease and a reverse transcriptase and contains eight embedded genes. C Genes in a 40 kb locus on Contig15 of the P. pacificus Hybrid 1 assembly.Microtubule-associated proteins were also enriched  , including several dynein and kinesin-related putative motor proteins of unknown function. Treatment with C2 had the greatest impact on phosphorylation sites of inner membrane complex IMC proteins and components of the gliding motor  , such as the two glideosome-associated proteins GAP45 and GAPM2  , and IMC1b.Among WSSV homologs represented multiple times the homologs to wsv327 and wsv191 were detected at least thrice: wsv327 with five fragments of varying lengths  , one of them being the intact ORF neighboring a homolog of wsv332 the adjacent ORF in the WSSV genome; and wsv191 the endonuclease represented by three different copies  , one of them being the intact ORF neighboring a homolog of wsv192. 1 corresponds to a region on scaffold III intersecting intact homologs of wsv327 and wsv147 interrupted by a fragment homologous to wsv191  , and a similar region with broken copies of all three ORFs on scaffold II.The presence of streptavidin was confirmed by gel shift. Streptavidin was bound to biotinylated DNA by incubating 50 nM DNA with 1 μM streptavidin NEB at room temperature in the endonuclease reaction buffer for 15 min immediately prior to use.These results suggest an in planta requirement for the favorable protein-DNA contact of Glutamine Q at position 80  , which improves the cleavage activity of PB1+. In contrast  , plant lines JJS24 and JJS25 containing the PB1+ endonuclease with the Q80 mutation  , lose the internal PstI site after endonuclease induction Figure 2B  , 2C  , and Additional file 1.∼5 ,000 female F1 progeny containing all three elements were crossed to UAS-mCD8::GFP  , and the F2 progeny screened for candidates with changes in the GFP expression pattern relative to the donors alone. Donors were crossed to the line containing heat-shock-inducible FLP recombinase and I-SceI endonuclease transgenes 29 and larvae were heat shocked for 1 h at 37°C on days 3 and 4 of development.miRNAs are generated from a stem-loop primary transcript by the endonuclease Dicer-like 1 DCL1 and its partners. In general  , small RNAs are grouped into two major classes  , microRNAs miRNAs and short-interfering RNAs siRNAs based on the mechanisms by which they are synthesized and function 1.Without PCR optimization  , comparable numbers of colonies were obtained using a molar vector to insert ratio of 1:8 as summarized in Table 2. While all other tested proofreading enzymes failed to generate PCR products suitable for endonuclease V-mediated cloning  , all three types of recombinants pIRES2-AmpR  , pUC19-mRFP1  , pBSK-Mitf were successfully created by using the Pfu DNA polymerase mutant in place of the Taq enzyme.The structure of the duplex suggests that it is modified by other enzymes  , such as the ERI-1 3′ exonuclease  , to produce the 19 nucleotide passenger strand Figure S6. This is most likely the RdRP RRF-3  , preferentially using a guanylate as an initiation nucleotide  , that in conjuction with an endonuclease  , possibly Dicer  , generates a 26G siRNA duplex and continues doing so along the mRNA starting at a neighboring cytosine in the mRNA template 17.Position +1 corresponds to the position of bottom-strand cleavage based on the 3' junctions of all R1 elements as well as from in vitro studies of the R1 endonuclease 12 ,13. Various regions of the sequence have been indicated with colors to allow the 5' and 3' junctions of the R1 insertions to be summarized.Recently  , another RNA-related aberrance was observed in HSV-1-infected cells: about half of the transcribed host cell genes experience transcriptional read-through 8. Finally  , matured mRNAs are cleaved by the viral vhs/SOX endonuclease  , and thus targeted for degradation 6  , 7.2 Once established  , the Naegleria intron co-evolved along with its host rDNA by maintaining intron activities including intron splicing  , endonuclease mRNA capping  , and homing endonuclease DNA cleavage. 1 A pre-organized twin-ribozyme group I intron was gained in the rDNA early in evolution of the Naegleria genus  , but after the Cluster 6 branching see Figure 1.It is perhaps surprising that the HO gene that degenerated is the A-homeolog  , whereas the broken MAT locus is the B-homeolog  , but the 2 endonucleases are likely to have had identical site specificities because the HO cleavage site is well conserved among species. Another is the HO endonuclease gene  , whose A-homeolog contains an identical 1-bp deletion in both ATCC60483 and ISA1307  , whereas the B-homeolog of HO is intact in both strains S2 Table.The junction of Illumina adaptor 1 and CATG site is the recognition site of MmeI  , which is a type of Endonuclease with separated recognition sites and digestion sites. The fragments apart from the 3' cDNA fragments connected to OligodT beads are washed away and the Illumina adaptor 1 is ligated to the sticky 5' end of the digested bead-bound cDNA fragments.The Cdc2 cluster contains several interesting cell cycle genes  , including cdc2 itself; SPBC1861.01c and abp2  , which code for AT hook proteins thought to bind centromeric DNA and ARS DNA  , respectively;res1  , a key component of the MBF transcription factor; sds22  , a protein phosphatase regulatory subunit known to be involved in the cell cycle; ash2  , a member of the SET1 complex  , and involved in lysine methylation of histone H3; alp1  , a tubulin-specific chaperone; SPCC18.03  , a putative transcriptional regulator; pkl1  , a kinesin-like protein of the Kar3 family; and other genes. Motif search programs found heat shock motifs NGAAN associated with many of these genes.We then examined whether the designed PB1 endonuclease cleaves plant DNA containing the four base-pair center sequence RSGTAC found in the crystal structure described above. Similarly  , a need for an NLS on the engineered PB1 endonucleases is also demonstrated  , whereby nineteen out of thirty-six independent transgenic plants with the NLS JJS24 had PB1+ cleavage  , compared to two out of twenty-six independent transgenic plants without the NLS JJS25 Figure 2B  , 2C  , and Additional file 1.ACBD3 maintains the structure of the Golgi apparatus  , influences protein transport between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum  , and is an important component of several cellular signaling pathways reviewed by 86. The acyl-CoA binding domain containing proteins included acbd3 and acbd4.One of the hallmarks of L1-mediated retrotransposition of SVAs is that they often integrate at DNA sites resembling the L1 endonuclease consensus cleavage sites such as 5′-TTTT/A-3′ or 5′-CTTT/A-3′ 20. SVA elements are thought to integrate within genomic sequences via target-primed reverse transcription TPRT mediated by the LINE 1 protein machinery 16-19.Release of apoptotic factors  , such as cytochrome c  , Smac/diablo  , apoptosis-inducing factor AIF  , Omi/Htra2  , and endonuclease G from the mitochondrial intermembrane space can occur through two mechanisms 107 ,108. Loss of respiratory function is associated with activation of apoptosis e.g.  , see mouse models of mtDNA depletion in Table 1  , and mitochondrial bioenergetics are compromised in mitochondrial mutator mice 48 ,49.Positions -9 and +14 correspond to the inferred most frequent sites of top-strand cleavage. Position +1 corresponds to the position of bottom-strand cleavage based on the 3' junctions of all R1 elements as well as from in vitro studies of the R1 endonuclease 12 ,13.Another is the HO endonuclease gene  , whose A-homeolog contains an identical 1-bp deletion in both ATCC60483 and ISA1307  , whereas the B-homeolog of HO is intact in both strains S2 Table. One of these is the AC-to-AG splice site mutation in the B-homeolog of MATα2 described above Fig 5C.While glutamylation could play an important role in guiding motor-based transport in epithelial and neuronal cells 44 ,47–49  , it is not likely to play a critical role in fibroblasts. However  , the recognition of PTMs by the Kinesin-1 motor is likely to be complex as mutation of motor surface abolished the ability of Kinesin-1 to recognize detyrosinated but not acetylated microtubules 41.The BimC-related tetrameric kinesin  , Cut7p  , is essential for spindle formation and exhibits a complex cell cycle–specific pattern of localization 23 ,24. Given that the overexpression of Mia1p induced assembly of elongating spindles even though SPBs were not separated  , we were interested in determining the polarity of microtubules in these structures.Similar findings were observed for the genes SET domain containing 2 SETD  , accession ID: XM_011533632  , dipeptidyl peptidase 7 DPP7  , accession ID: NM_013379 and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ACADVL  , accession ID: NM_000018  , which are all found in the NCBI database Additional file 1: Figure S6A  , C  , and D. Moreover  , the covered regions of this gene were aligned to multiple CDSs  , a redundancy that was even more obvious in the CDSs predicted from Trinity-assembled transcripts.However  , the recognition of PTMs by the Kinesin-1 motor is likely to be complex as mutation of motor surface abolished the ability of Kinesin-1 to recognize detyrosinated but not acetylated microtubules 41. This possibility has gained support from recent work in vitro and in vivo 42–46.This implies that the subcellular localization of the JNK signaling complex in the neuron may be regulated by vesicular axonal transport or conversely that kinesin motor activity during axonal transport may itself be regulated via the JNK signaling pathway. The cJun NH2-terminal kinase JNK interacting protein JIP group is a class of proteins that may link the kinesin motor to cargo and also act as a scaffold for components of the stress-activated JNK kinase signaling pathway 47.Dynactin is also required for bidirectional transport of lipid droplets in Drosophila embryos and mediates the interaction between kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein in Xenopus melanophore cells 39 ,40. Strong genetic interactions have been observed between kinesin  , cytoplasmic dynein  , and the dynactin complex in Drosophila 35.To facilitate cloning desired genes into the CMV CP region  , we first created a separate CMV RNA 3-based plasmid and modified the intergenic nucleotide sequence upstream of the CP ORF start codon to contain desired restriction endonuclease sites Figure 1. We used real-time PCR to quantify levels of progeny RNAs 1  , 2  , 3  , and 3 plus 4 because RNA 4 is a subset of RNA 3 and is therefore difficult to differentiate from RNA 3.The promoters of these genes were enriched in several GC-rich motifs  , which might define Rsv1p-binding sites see Table 1 in Additional data file 5. Many of the induced genes are involved in carbohydrate metabolism  , including genes for an inducer of gluconate transport gti1  , four hexose transporters ght1  , ght3  , ght4  , and ght8  , a hexokinase hsx2  , 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase SPB660.16  , and a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase SPCC794.01c.In addition to mobilizing its own transcripts  , LINE-1 mobilizes other transcripts including  , but probably not limited to  , Alu 11  , SINE-VNTR-Alu 12 and processed pseudogenes 13. In humans  , this process is carried out chiefly through the reverse-transcriptase 7 and endonuclease 8 functions of the LINE-1 ORF2 protein  , with assistance from the ORF1 protein  , which binds RNA 9 and functions as a chaperone 10.We therefore favor a model in which an Mlh1-Mlh3 heterodimer interior to the polymer is activated and introduces nicks. When wild-type and endonuclease-inactive proteins are mixed together at up to a 1:3 stoichiometric ratio  , one would expect that if the initiating heterodimer were responsible for nicking  , the presence of Mlh1-mlh3D523N would be inhibitory.The cleavage frequency was calculated from the proportion of cut bands intensity to total bands intensity. The amplicons were denatured by heating and annealed to form heteroduplex DNA  , which was treated with 5 units of T7 endonuclease 1 New England Biolabs for 20 min at 37 °C and then analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.Assay characteristics for genotyping the haplotype-tagging SNPs in IGF-1  , IGFBP-1  , and IGFBP-3 are available on a public website 43. Genotyping was conducted with a fluorescent 5' endonuclease assay and the ABI-PRISM 7900 for sequence detection TaqMan 37 ,38.Reactions were stopped by the addition of a stop mix solution containing final concentrations of 0.1% SDS  , 14 mM EDTA  , and 0.1 mg/mL ProteinaseK NEB. Endonuclease reactions were performed as previously described 26 in endonuclease buffer: 20 mM HEPES- KOH pH 7.5  , 20 mM KCl  , 0.2 mg/mL BSA  , 1% glycerol  , and 1 mM MgCl2 unless otherwise indicated.Although having preferences for certain structures  , Mlh1-Mlh3 is an overall efficient DNA-binding complex 26 ,27. However  , in the oligonucleotide competition endonuclease assay presented here Fig 1  , HJ and +8 loop–containing oligonucleotide substrates acted as very strong competitors relative to homoduplex DNA  , which was an ineffective competing substrate compared to plasmid DNA.The predicted Recombination Endonuclease VII and DNA POLB2 domains are indicated. a Amino acid alignment of the Sf Maverick 1 and 2 POLB proteins and the B. mori densovirus 3 DNA polymerase.B At 1 dpf  , a representative sampling of 8 founders and 8 non-injected controls were selected and subjected to T7 endonuclease 1 T7E1 assay. A Schematic of the zebrafish apol1 locus and location of the guide RNA gRNA target used for apol1-CRISPR experiments; the primers used to PCR-amplify the target region are shown arrowheads.The wild-type strain carrying the HMLα donor yXW2 and an isogenic strain carrying the rfa1-t11 mutation yXW3 were treated with 2% galactose to induce HO endonuclease and then with 2% glucose after 1 h to repress further HO expression. Another set of DNA samples was taken at the same time for Southern blot analysis.DNA extracted at intervals after HO cutting was split. The wild-type strain carrying the HMLα donor yXW2 and an isogenic strain carrying the rfa1-t11 mutation yXW3 were treated with 2% galactose to induce HO endonuclease and then with 2% glucose after 1 h to repress further HO expression.After overnight incubation at 28°C  , single colonies were purified and successful recombination was checked by monitoring absence of antibiotic resistance  , colony PCR with oligonucleotides 01-E and P
adrA Rv  , and sequencing of the resulting fragment. After 1 h of incubation at 28°C  , 100 μl of a 10−2 dilution was plated on LB agar plates containing 500 ng ml-1 anhydrotetracycline  , which induced expression of I-SceI endonuclease.Protein expression was then induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside  , Uptima and incubation at 24°C for 3 h. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 20 mM NaCl  , 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.4  , 10 mM MgCl2  , lysozyme  , endonuclease and antiprotease agents Complete  , Roche. The overnight culture was diluted 25-fold with fresh LB medium complemented with ampicillin and cultured at 37°C until an OD at 600 nm of 0.9 was reached.c: Agarose gel electrophoresis of 0.2 kb PCR products amplified with the R26F2/R26R2 primer pair from blastocysts derived from microinjected zygotes 25 ng/μl sgRosa26-1 and 50 ng/μl Cas9 mRNA top. Genomic DNA was extracted from each blastocyst and used for PCR amplification of the target region and genotyping by XbaI or T7 endonuclease I T7EI.Together  , these comparisons indicate that inGAP-CDG is more reliable than other pipelines for full-length CDS prediction. Similar findings were observed for the genes SET domain containing 2 SETD  , accession ID: XM_011533632  , dipeptidyl peptidase 7 DPP7  , accession ID: NM_013379 and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ACADVL  , accession ID: NM_000018  , which are all found in the NCBI database Additional file 1: Figure S6A  , C  , and D.Previous findings have implicated the phosphorylation of SEPT3 by cGMP-dependent protein kinase I PKG-I in nerve terminals in presynaptic plasticity 13  , 14. In mammalian cells  , several studies have identified PTMs on septins  , but little is known about the roles of PTMs in septin assembly.pKUb was made by cloning nucleotides 3561–4771 of the human UbC gene genbank accession D63791  , which contains the UbC promoter  , non-coding exon 1  , and intron 1  , into pK-SV40A between intact BglII and NheI restriction endonuclease sites. pKUb-SB11- A 1.0 kb fragment of the SB11 transposase from pCMV-SB11 72  , which had been amplified with CDS-SB11-F1 CACCATGGGAAAATCAAAAGAAATCAGCC and CDS-SB11-R1 GGATCCCAATTTAAAGGCAATGCTACCAAATACTAG primers and subcloned into an intermediate vector adding a 5' BglII site and the sequence AGATCTGAT  , was cloned into the BamHI site of pKUb to make pKUb-SB11.Optimum endonuclease activity for Mlh1-Mlh3 was seen at an ~100:1 ratio of Mlh1-Mlh3 to 2.7 kb plasmid. Although Mlh1-Mlh3 nicked all circular substrates tested  , activity was directly proportional to plasmid size in the presence either Mg2+ or Mn2+ cofactor.The following amounts of added polymerase correspond to comparable polymerase activity on normal template primer: 5 x 10−4 units/μl Pol I KF USB  , 1 nM PolII  , 2 nM PolIII*  , 4 nM Pol IV or 100 nM Pol V. Finally the reaction product is digested by a restriction endonuclease before PAGE analysis. A given DNA polymerase is added and the mixture is incubated for 30 min at 30°C as indicated.This finding suggested that multiple Mlh1-Mlh3 molecules interact on the DNA substrate to activate endonuclease activity. Optimum endonuclease activity for Mlh1-Mlh3 was seen at an ~100:1 ratio of Mlh1-Mlh3 to 2.7 kb plasmid.DNA segments complementary to the ends of the template molecule were designed to reach Tm values of ≥ 53°C. In order to create 3′ protruding ends by endonuclease V treatment of the PCR products  , a single deoxyinosine residue was placed at the third position of the primer 5′ end compare Figure 1.In metaphase wild-type cells  , Cut7p-GFP was concentrated at spindle poles and localized along the entire spindle length. The BimC-related tetrameric kinesin  , Cut7p  , is essential for spindle formation and exhibits a complex cell cycle–specific pattern of localization 23 ,24.Fla8 is the homolog of mammalian Kif3b and C. elegans KLP-11. In addition  , a similar calcium dependent kinase CrCDPK1 in Chlamydomonas phosphorylates Fla8 to regulate its association with the IFT particle complex B and kinesin turnaround in cilia 41.In contrast  , plant lines JJS24 and JJS25 containing the PB1+ endonuclease with the Q80 mutation  , lose the internal PstI site after endonuclease induction Figure 2B  , 2C  , and Additional file 1. Plant lines containing JJS26 express the PB1 endonuclease with the naturally occurring E80 residue  , and upon induction of the PB1 endonuclease  , the PstI site is intact.The more divergent testis-specific adenine deaminase domain-contain proteins ADAD1 and ADAD2 lack key catalytic residues but are still evolutionarily conserved  , presumably acting as dsRNA-binding proteins 20 ,21. ADAR1 and ADAR2 are enzymatically active for review  , 18 but enzymatic activity has never been demonstrated for the brain-specific ADAR3 protein  , even though it closely resembles ADAR2 19.Rte-1 encodes an endonuclease and a reverse transcriptase enclosed by target site duplication sequences at the 5' and 3' end. These genes are remote homologs of the C. elegans retrotransposable element Rte-1 19  , a member of the non-LTR retrotransposable elements.The amplicons were denatured by heating and annealed to form heteroduplex DNA  , which was treated with 5 units of T7 endonuclease 1 New England Biolabs for 20 min at 37 °C and then analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.

We found that at birth  , expression of several genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid and acylcarnitine metabolism are up-regulated in the wild-type heart at p0.5  , including ACC acetyl coA carboxylase  , MCD malonyl coA decarboxylase  , and CPT isoforms carnitine palmitoyl transferase as previously reported 21–24  , along with FABP fatty acid binding protein  , FATP fatty acid transport protein  , ACSL acyl coA synthase long chain 1  , HSL hormone sensitive lipase  , and ATGL adipose triglyceride lipase Figure 3A ,B.The 26G siRNAs and the corresponding downstream 22G siRNAs  , collectively called the ‘ERI’ class of siRNAs  , all depend on a protein complex that includes the 3′-5′ exonuclease ERI-1  , the RdRP RRF-3  , the endonuclease DCR-1/ERI-4  , and the dsRNA binding protein RDE-4 22–24. Genetic  , molecular and biochemical analyses have identified several genes and proteins involved in endogenous siRNA formation and function.These products were treated with T7 endonuclease I New England Biolabs at 37 °C for 1 h. The digested DNA fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Then the DNA solution was subjected to denaturing 95 °C  , 2 min and re-annealing RT  , 1 h to form a heteroduplex.We entertained three explanations for the above observations: 1 Preexisting nicks are preferential loading sites for Mlh1-Mlh3 polymer formation and direct Mlh1-Mlh3 to nick directly opposite the preexisting nick. Such a model argues that Mlh1-Mlh3’s endonuclease acts distinctly from Mus81-Mms4 and is supported by the finding that the amount of linear product is similar in reactions containing closed circular or prenicked substrates 26.We isolated genomic DNA at 10 dpi with the TYLCV infectious clone and PCR amplified a 560-bp fragment encompassing the IR target sequence  , which contains two additional SspI sites Supplementary sequence 1 in Additional file 4.

After treatment with 5 u of Tma endonuclease V  , a ligation reaction with dephosphorylated pUC19 digested with AatII and PstI was set up using a molar insert to vector ratio of 7:1.This also resulted in changes to the mRNA 4 nucleotide leader sequence immediately preceding the AUG start codon and therefore could affect mRNA translation efficiency 18-20. To facilitate cloning desired genes into the CMV CP region  , we first created a separate CMV RNA 3-based plasmid and modified the intergenic nucleotide sequence upstream of the CP ORF start codon to contain desired restriction endonuclease sites Figure 1.Strong genetic interactions have been observed between kinesin  , cytoplasmic dynein  , and the dynactin complex in Drosophila 35. One candidate to mediate this coordination is the dynactin complex 38.The single open reading frame ORF of 990 amino acids contains two conserved domains  , an AP apurinic endonuclease domain and an RT reverse transcriptase domain. A full-length element that we have named HmRTE-e01 sharing all the major features of RTE elements was identified in BAC clone AEHM-22C5 from Heliconius melpomene GenBank:CU462842 Figure 1.Reactions were stopped by adding stop buffer 50 mM Tris‐HCl  , 100 mM NaCl  , 0.1 % SDS  , 100 mM EDTA  , 1 mM spermidine  , 0.5 spermine  , pH 8.0 and purified fragments were recovered by sucrose ultracentrifugation  , end‐repaired and ligated with adapters  , followed by sequencing on the Illumina sequencing platform. Then  , nuclei were incubated for 3 minutes at 37 °C in the same lysis buffer with 1 mM CaCl2 and with limiting concentrations of the DNA endonuclease deoxyribonuclease I DNase I.Fourteen of the 21 introns were selected for more detail structural characterizations see Table 1. The most prominent differences between the Naegleria and Tetrahymena ribozymes are the lack of a P9.2 segment in Naegleria  , the presence of an optional tetra-loop in L5b  , and a large sequence insertion approximately 950 nt in P6b harboring the homing endonuclease gene NaHEG and the capping ribozyme NaGIR1 Figure 2.Conservation of deaminase domain fold structure and key active site residues show that the ADARs are members of the cytidine deaminase protein family CDAs; different cytosine deaminases edit cytosine to uracil in RNA or DNA or both 22. The more divergent testis-specific adenine deaminase domain-contain proteins ADAD1 and ADAD2 lack key catalytic residues but are still evolutionarily conserved  , presumably acting as dsRNA-binding proteins 20 ,21.Once the genomic DNA has been fragmented with a specific restriction endonuclease such as MseI  , the capture oligonucleotide pools and genomic DNA are incubated together in a single reaction volume Figure 1. We provide detailed description including DNA sequences and corresponding molecular biology of targeted sequencing library preparation assay in Additional File 1.When wild-type and endonuclease-inactive proteins are mixed together at up to a 1:3 stoichiometric ratio  , one would expect that if the initiating heterodimer were responsible for nicking  , the presence of Mlh1-mlh3D523N would be inhibitory. Our data in Fig 6 argue against this model  , however.In humans  , this process is carried out chiefly through the reverse-transcriptase 7 and endonuclease 8 functions of the LINE-1 ORF2 protein  , with assistance from the ORF1 protein  , which binds RNA 9 and functions as a chaperone 10. Retrotransposition refers to the insertion of DNA sequences mediated by an RNA intermediate 6.TZM-bl cells a HeLa cell line expressing HIV-1 co-receptors and a lacZ reporter gene under control of an HIV-1 LTR promoter were infected with 293T cell produced VSV-G-pseudotyped Δvif-HIV-1 virions containing various ratios of wt-hA3G to E259Q-mutant hA3G hA3G titration experiment or Δvif-HIV-1 virions containing hA3G and patient derived Vif patient-derived Vif experiment. For sequencing experiments  , total DNA was extracted from infected cells using the DNeasy DNA extraction kit Qiagen Inc  , CA  , USA and digested with DpnI New England Biolabs  , a restriction endonuclease that specifically targets methylated DNA  , to remove carried-over transfection mixture.Kinesin family member 7 KIF7 is a microtubule interacting protein that functions to regulate Hh signaling by maintaining the architecture of the primary cilium 11  , a complex microtubule based organelle with many signal transduction functions 12 ,13. Hedgehog Hh signaling is a potent regulator of the development and maintenance of numerous tissues 10.Following sequencing on a HiSeq2000 platform Illumina; approximately 2 × 107 reads  , data were analysed using the r3Cseq pipeline 50. Nuclei were harvested after 0 or 30 min of TNFα stimulation  , cross-linked in 1% paraformaldehyde PFA; Electron Microscopy Science  , Munich  , Germany  , and processed as described 21 using ApoI as the primary restriction endonuclease.For example  , 027 strains are invariably designated as BI by restriction endonuclease analysis  , NAP1 North American pulsotype 1 by pulse field gel electrophoresis  , are exclusively toxinotype III by toxinotyping and are indistinguishable by multi-locus sequence analysis 11. PCR-ribotype 027 strains are genetically highly uniform  , which is confirmed by the application of diverse genotyping methods.Additionally  , we found that the molecular motors kinesin and dynein are important for anterior-posterior patterning of the PVD dendritic arbor  , and demonstrated genetic interactions between both RAB-10/kinesin-1 and RAB-10/dynein in patterning the anterior-posterior distribution of branches. We identified novel roles for the small GTPase RAB-10 and the exocyst complex in dendrite morphogenesis of the C. elegans PVD neuron using genetic approaches.Since most endonucleases cut at single-stranded RNA  , this indicates that the RNA fragments were cut at their 3′ end by an endonuclease in eIF4A3-iCLIP2  , while additional factors may contribute to the RNA fragmentation in eIF4A3-iCLIP1. The cDNA-end peak in eIF4A3-iCLIP2  , but not eIF4A3-iCLIP1  , coincides with a strong decrease in pairing probability Additional file 1: Figure S4C  , D.To date  , 414 miRNAs from 151 miRNA families miRBase  , http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/  , Release 14.0  , including several natural antisense miRNAs nat-miRNAs and a mitron  , have been identified in rice 2 ,3. miRNAs are generated from a stem-loop primary transcript by the endonuclease Dicer-like 1 DCL1 and its partners.
