The methyl-CpG-binding domain MBD proteins are among these protein families that bind specifically to a methylated gene and mediate transcriptional repression via effects on chromatin structure. In fact  , there is growing evidence that aberrant expression of MBD proteins is associated with human cancers 8 ,9.Additional factors  , possibly functioning in various protein complexes with MeCP2  , may act to recruit MeCP2 to the chromatin. The ability of the R106W and Δ166 mutants to associate with chromosomes implies that the methyl-CpG-binding domain is not required for this activity.To date eight SVA insertions have been associated with disease 14 ,15  , these include for example a SVA in the 3’UTR of the fukutin gene which causes Fukyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy by decreasing mRNA production  , and a SVA insertion and subsequent 14 kb deletion of the HLA-A gene locus linked with leukaemia 16 ,17. A recent study to determine the nature of SVA retrotransposition revealed that no individual domain of an SVA is fundamental for this to occur  , but each domain differentially affected the rate at which retrotransposition can take place 13.Thus  , the zebrafish system may provide a genetically and embryologically accessible model to complement investigations in mammalian model systems. Morpholinos MOs against two of these genes have been characterized  , and both lead to muscle degeneration Fukutin related protein Q0PIP5_DANRE  , LARGE 2 LARG2_DANRE 16 ,17.The extent of tissue-specific DNA methylation differences in the super-enhancer regions was low  , with only 12.6 % 644 out of 5111 of them showing CpG methylation differences from different normal tissues δ hypomethylated regions HMRs occupancy >10 %; Supplementary methods  , Figure S4a and Table S2 in Additional file 1. As examples of super-enhancer tissue-specific DNA methylation we can cite the genes encoding the RNA-binding protein QKI involved in myelinization and oligodendrocyte differentiation  , which is unmethylated in white brain matter but heavily methylated in all other normal tissues Figure S5a in Additional file 1  , and lymphoblastic leukemia-associated hematopoiesis regulator 1 LYL1; plays a role in blood vessel maturation and hematopoiesis  , which is unmethylated in CD19+ cells but hypermethylated in all other normal tissues Figure S5b in Additional file 1.The MeCP2 protein contains a methyl-CpG-binding domain MBD and localizes to the heterochromatin where it is believed to regulate gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases to alter chromatin structure 11 ,12. Similar phenotypes are recapitulated in mice that either lack or overexpress MECP2  , thus underscoring the importance of properly regulating MeCP2 levels 7–10.Here we show that the methyl-CpG-binding domain is not necessary for association of the MeCP2 protein with chromatin in polytene chromosomes Figures 1H-H”  , nor is it required to produce an eye phenotype in Drosophila Figures 2D-D”. Furthermore  , a recent study of gene expression patterns in mice that either lack or overexpress MeCP2 suggests that many genes are activated by MeCP2 41.Indeed  , several studies point to a major role of CpG methylation in nucleosome positioning and binding of multiples protein factors could be involve in repositioning of nucleosome 57  , 58. Accordingly  , demethylation of the 5′ETS rRNA gene sequences and activation of VAR1 suggest that AtNUC-L1 maintains gene methylation required for accurate nucleosome position for transcription Figure 8.While an ortholog for the complete MeCP2 protein does not exist in Drosophila  , methyl-CpG-binding domains are conserved from flies to humans 13. The MeCP2 protein contains a methyl-CpG-binding domain MBD and localizes to the heterochromatin where it is believed to regulate gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases to alter chromatin structure 11 ,12.Previous studies demonstrated a critical role for the KRAB zinc finger protein ZFP57 in the maintenance of DNA methylation at multiple imprinted germline DMRs in mice and human 19  , 20. This is consistent with studies demonstrating that methylation of a CpG within the binding motif is necessary for ZFP57 binding in vitro 21.Apart from calponin 1  , other actin-binding molecules such caldesmon 1  , cortactin and palladin were also identified. High abundance of calponin 1 in old tenocyte TEC may be related to changes in ECM content that affect mechanical properties of the engineered tissue and increase mechanical strain detected by the cells.The MED-1 sequence is a downstream protein-binding element previously linked to TATA-less promoters with multiple distinct start sites Butler and Kadonaga 2002. This motif was found around 35.9% of the hypomethylated copies of these discordant CpG sites but at only 5.04% of the matching hypermethylated copies P = 1 × 10−12.In this study  , therefore  , we use methyl-CpG binding domain MBD protein-based enrichment coupled to NGS MBD-seq to assay DNA methylation in human blood 21. As an alternative to WGBS  , enrichment for the methylated genomic fraction followed by NGS can yield information on many millions of methylation sites 20.Furthermore we observed differential methylation of one CpG in MBD4 ∆beta 0.08  , a methyl-CpG-binding domain protein and DNA glycosylase with excision activity against 5-methyl cytosine. In subcutaneous adipose we saw differential methylation of two CpG sites within DNA methyl-transferase DNMT3A ∆beta 0.11  , 0.08 and DNMT3L ∆beta 0.09 which can act with DNMT3A to stimulate de novo methylation  , and also interacts with histone deacetylase 1.Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting are as follows: rabbit anti-Perp 20 1:200  , mouse anti-desmoplakin clone 115F 1:500  , mouse anti-desmoglein 1/2 clone 4B2 1:1 ,000  , chicken anti-plakoglobin 1408 1:5 ,000  , mouse anti-desmocollin 2 Abcam  , Cambridge  , MA  , USA; 1:5 ,000  , mouse anti-β actin peroxidase conjugate Sigma Chemical Corp.; 1:1 ,000  , mouse anti-GAPDH Fitzgerald Laboratories  , Acton  , MA  , USA; 1:15 ,000. Equal amounts of total protein for each sample were subjected to Western blot analysis using standard protocols.Conversely  , a group of zinc-finger TFs  , including the BTB/POZ family proteins KAISO  , ZTB4  , and ZBTB38  , as well as the Krüppel-associated box KRAB-domain TF family member ZFP57  , all recognize methylated CpGs within DNA sequence motifs and can act as repressors by perpetuating local CpG hypermethylation 77. Last  , methyltransferase enzymes themselves can show some DNA-sequence preferences 80  , 81  , and members of the methyl-binding proteins family e.g.  , MeCP2 and MBD2  , while lacking sequence-specificity  , participate in protein complexes that bind highly methylated CpG-rich sequences and can help to maintain repressive chromatin 82.The second genome-wide DNA methylation screening methodology we applied  , to the same eight NB cell lines  , was MBD-seq: massively parallel sequencing of methylation-enriched DNA fragments  , whereby the enrichment is based on the capture of methylated sheared DNA using the high affinity of the methyl-CpG-binding domain  of the protein MBD2 towards methylated cytosines. Also  , some miRNAs appeared to be methylated in their promoter region.This process requires three enzymes  , including mevalonate kinase  , phosphomevalonate kinase and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase 18. In the native MVA pathway  , MVA is phosphorylated twice and decarboxylated to form IPP.MXI1 and MAX Myc-associated factor X both interact with c-Myc myelocytomatosis oncogene  , a well-characterized oncogene  , which has been shown to be methylation sensitive  , meaning that the TF motifs contain CpG sites and  , thus  , TF binding is sensitive to methylation status at those sites 75. It has been suggested that suppression of MAZ Myc-associated zinc finger protein may be associated with DNA methyltransferase I  , the key factor for de novo DNA methylation 73 ,74.Taken together  , these results suggest that mevalonate blockade suppresses DKK-1 via inhibited geranylgeranylation of Cdc42 and Rho. In addition  , treatment of cells with Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitors Y-27632 and H-1152P significantly decreased DKK-1 Figure 
4F.In this context  , AtNUC-L1 activity might be required for rRNA gene methylation or demethylation to repress or activates RNA Pol I transcription. Indeed  , several studies point to a major role of CpG methylation in nucleosome positioning and binding of multiples protein factors could be involve in repositioning of nucleosome 57  , 58.It has been reported that clusters of unmethylated CpG can recruit H3K4me3  , a modification associated with sites of transcriptional initiation  , via the CpG binding protein Cfp1 14. Visual inspection suggests that many CpG-deficient orphans which score as H3K4me3-negative possess this modification at levels below the detection limit of ChIP-seq.Retrotransposition events are repressed in somatic cells via epigenetic modifications and post transcriptional suppression but there is recent evidence for these events occurring in the adult brain and their insertions are associated with protein coding genes active in the brain 18. To date eight SVA insertions have been associated with disease 14 ,15  , these include for example a SVA in the 3’UTR of the fukutin gene which causes Fukyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy by decreasing mRNA production  , and a SVA insertion and subsequent 14 kb deletion of the HLA-A gene locus linked with leukaemia 16 ,17.Moreover  , loss of MeCP2 results in structural alternation of the nucleolus in cortical neurons 45  , raising the possibility that MeCP2 somehow counteracts condensin II in neurons. On the other hand  , it has been shown that overexpression of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 MeCP2  , whose mutations cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome 44  , induce hyperclustering of chromocenters in mouse cells 30  , 31.Loss of MeCP2 function causes classic Rett syndrome RTT  , but can also lead to related neurological conditions with symptoms that include autism  , mild or severe mental retardation with seizures  , or learning disabilities 2 ,3. Research in the last decade has linked the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 MeCP2 with a variety of related neurological disorders 1.Histone modifications were also identified as better indicators of expression stability than CpG methylation and histone binding proteins like HP1. Gene silencing due to histone modifications appeared to reduce the benefits of using CpGfree to improve long-term recombinant protein expression stability in CHO cells.On the right  , MEP pathway steps are described: GAP  , D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DXP  , 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; MEP  , 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate; CDP-ME ,4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol; MEcPP  , 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2 ,4-cyclodiphosphate; HMBPP  , 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate; IPP  , isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP  , dimethylallyl diphosphate. Enzymes are indicated in bold: AACT  , acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; HMGS  , HMG-CoA synthase; HMGR  , HMG-CoA reductase; MVK  , mevalonate kinase; PMVK  , 5-phosphomevalonate kinase; DPMD  , 5-diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; IDI  , IPP/DMAPP isomerase.Here we demonstrate this in vivo for the endogenous full-length protein  , showing that ZFP57 always follows the methylated allele in cases of both imprinted Fig. It has been demonstrated in vitro that ZFP57 zinc fingers 2–3 are responsible for binding motif recognition and have the highest affinity when a central CpG dinucleotide in the motif is fully methylated 21  , 45.Enzymes are indicated in bold: AACT  , acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; HMGS  , HMG-CoA synthase; HMGR  , HMG-CoA reductase; MVK  , mevalonate kinase; PMVK  , 5-phosphomevalonate kinase; DPMD  , 5-diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; IDI  , IPP/DMAPP isomerase. On the left  , MVA pathway is represented.On the other hand  , it has been shown that overexpression of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 MeCP2  , whose mutations cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome 44  , induce hyperclustering of chromocenters in mouse cells 30  , 31. In this sense  , it is noteworthy that a hypomorphic mutation of Ncaph2 was reported to specifically affect T-cell differentiation and survival in mice 42  , presumably through a failure in condensin II-dependent structural reorganization of interphase chromatin 43.MBD-seq has been demonstrated to be sensitive and capable of identifying differentially methylated regions 20–25  , to detect previously reported robust associations 26  , and to produce findings that replicate using more sensitive  , targeted technologies 27. In this study  , therefore  , we use methyl-CpG binding domain MBD protein-based enrichment coupled to NGS MBD-seq to assay DNA methylation in human blood 21.This process typically requires five reactions  , including a two-step phosphorylation catalyzed by mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase  , a one-step decarboxylation catalyzed by mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase  , a one-step isomerization catalyzed by IPP isomerase and a one-step dephosphorylation catalyzed by isoprene synthase 7  , 9  , 24. In the previous studies  , several research groups  , including ours  , established pathways for the conversion of MVA to isoprene.Similar to our findings  , whole-genome bisulfite sequencing showed that approximately 36% of identified age-associated  , differentially methylated regions were within LADs
44. The methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 was shown to interact with the lamin B receptor and may connect DNA methylation with nuclear architecture
60.Finally  , the commonly-used density measure mCG/CG represents a comparison between methylated and unmethylated CpG sites in a given genomic region  , which may reflect the “competitiveness” of the region for events such as protein binding. Another quantification measure  , the number of methylated CpG sites per unit length  , mCG/len  , may be more related to the average speed reduction of the elongating polymerase.The methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 was shown to interact with the lamin B receptor and may connect DNA methylation with nuclear architecture
60. Some studies have shown that nuclear architecture could be altered during normal aging beyond just modifications connected with premature aging syndromes
59.The divergent promoters drive expression of ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes  , encoding the TATA binding protein and proteasome component-B1 in the case of the TBP locus  , and the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 and chromobox homolog 3 in the case of the RNP locus. These regions are structurally similar  , containing dual divergently transcribed promoters embedded within an extended methylation-free CpG island.The DS-DM in this gene is also localized to the promoter  , but there is some prior evidence that promoter methylation may normally activate transcription of NLGN2: MeCP2  , a methylated CpG-binding protein that can either activate or repress genes and associates with the transcriptional activator CREB1 27  , can bind one of the Nlgn2 promoters in mice  , and activate transcription in reporter assays 28. In contrast to STK19  , Q-PCR for NLGN2 mRNA revealed increased mRNA expression in the DS brains Figure S18 in Additional file 1.Secondary antibodies included HRP goat anti-mouse 1:5 ,000  , HRP goat anti-chicken 1:5 ,000  , HRP goat anti-rabbit 1:5 ,000; Jackson Immunoresearch  , West Grove  , PA  , USA. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting are as follows: rabbit anti-Perp 20 1:200  , mouse anti-desmoplakin clone 115F 1:500  , mouse anti-desmoglein 1/2 clone 4B2 1:1 ,000  , chicken anti-plakoglobin 1408 1:5 ,000  , mouse anti-desmocollin 2 Abcam  , Cambridge  , MA  , USA; 1:5 ,000  , mouse anti-β actin peroxidase conjugate Sigma Chemical Corp.; 1:1 ,000  , mouse anti-GAPDH Fitzgerald Laboratories  , Acton  , MA  , USA; 1:15 ,000.We confirmed the identity of ems_2_129 via introgression of the mbd9-3 insertional allele into an atxr5/6 background  , and by performing complementation analysis Fig 4E. MBD9 is a protein with a methyl CpG binding domain previously identified as a regulator of flowering time with potential roles in histone H4 acetylation 23 ,24.In this context it is interesting to note that unlike mammals  , bacteria  , plants  , and other insects  , the levels of DNA methylation are very low in Drosophila
42. Here we show that the methyl-CpG-binding domain is not necessary for association of the MeCP2 protein with chromatin in polytene chromosomes Figures 1H-H”  , nor is it required to produce an eye phenotype in Drosophila Figures 2D-D”.This reversible addition of methyl groups at cytosines within CpG dinucleotides can promote the recruitment of protein complexes that repress transcription and also prevent the binding of transcription factors to their binding motifs 15 ,16. Such epigenetic alterations primarily involve DNA hypermethylation events within the promoter regions of individual candidate genes.Consistent with these findings we confirmed that the majority of H3K4me3 enriched loci map to CGIs in human and mouse ES cells 74.6 and 84.1% respectively. It has been reported that clusters of unmethylated CpG can recruit H3K4me3  , a modification associated with sites of transcriptional initiation  , via the CpG binding protein Cfp1 14.OleTJE from Jeotgalicoccus species; OhyAEM from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica. Enzyme symbols: MvaE acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase/HMG-CoA reductase and MvaS HMG-CoA synthase from Enterococcus faecalis; ERG12 mevalonate kinase  , ERG8 phosphomevalonate kinase  , ERG19 mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase and IDI1 IPP isomerase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae; IspS isoprene synthase from Populus alba.Enzyme symbols: MvaE acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase/HMG-CoA reductase and MvaS HMG-CoA synthase from Enterococcus faecalis; ERG12 mevalonate kinase  , ERG8 phosphomevalonate kinase  , ERG19 mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase and IDI1 IPP isomerase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae; IspS isoprene synthase from Populus alba. The dashed box shows the traditional pathway for MVA conversion to isoprene 8  , 9  , while the new pathway constructed in this study is within the solid-lined box.MeCP2 also interacts with other proteins involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling including Sin3a  , REST and Brahma  , a core component of the SWI/SNF complex 14–16. While an ortholog for the complete MeCP2 protein does not exist in Drosophila  , methyl-CpG-binding domains are conserved from flies to humans 13.Other notable features include gene clusters for a mevalonate-independent pathway of isoprenoid production and a type VI secretion system Island 3 of strain O6  , a chaperone-usher fimbrial biogenesis pathway Island 6 of strain SS101  , and an indole-3-acetic acid uptake and catabolism pathway Island 3 of BG33R. Among the cargo genes of these islands are those with predicted functions as components of restriction-modification systems Island 1 in 30-84; Island 1 in Q8r1-96  , assorted transporters Island 1 in 30-84; Islands 3 and 6 in SS101; Islands 3 and 4 in BG33R  , transcriptional regulators Island 2 in O6; Island 4 in Q8r1-96; Island 2 and 4 in Q2-87; Islands 2  , 4  , and 6 in SS101; Island 7 in BG33R  , two-component signal transduction systems Island 3 in 30-84; Islands 1  , 2  , and 3 in O6; Island 6 in SS101  , a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein Island 4 in SS101  , a polyphosphate kinase Island 3 in 30-84; Island 2 in O6  , a TonB-dependent outer-membrane receptor Island 1 in O6; Island 3 in BG33R  , a putative β-lactamase Island 4 in SS101  , a UV irradiation resistance protein Island 4 in SS101  , and a diverse array of conserved hypothetical proteins all strains.Top proteins enriched in the old TEC included cytoskeleton organization proteins calponin 1  , palladin  , collagens COL3A1  , COL4A2  , COL12A1 and transforming growth factor beta-induced protein TGFBI Fig. 3  , Table 1.The mevalonate pathway. ERG10 – acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase  , ERG13 – 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase  , human HMGR and yeast HMG1  , HMG2 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Co A reductase 1 and 2  , FPP1 – farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase  , ERG1 – squalene monooxygenase  , ERG6 – delta24-sterol C-methyltransferase  , ERG3 – C-5 sterol desaturase  , COQ3 – 3 ,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoatemethyltransferase  , COQ2 – para-hydroxybenzoate-polyprenyl transferase  , CAT5 – ubiquinone biosynthesis monooxygenase  , BTS1 – geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase  , RER2 – cis-prenyltransferase  , SEC59 – dolichol kinase.Similarly  , methylome mapping studies have highlighted genes that are perfectly conserved in their protein-coding sequences  , yet show significant differences in CpG methylation levels in their regulatory sequences between humans and chimpanzees 100  , 101. 87 compared PolII binding in human LCLs and a chimpanzee blood sample using ChIP-seq and found divergence at a substantial subset of orthologous genes between the two species.We did observe decreased methylation after gastric bypass and weight loss within one DNA methyl-transferase DNMT3A  , and its co-factor DNMT3L as well as within the gene for MBD4 a methyl-cytosine binding protein and DNA glycosylase. In proliferating cells passive loss of methylation can result from successive rounds of replication in the absence of restoration of CpG methylation by DNMT1 UHFR1  , or an initial active oxidation of methylated cytosine followed by replication-dependent dilution 71.Then  , using the enzyme pyrophosphatase or phosphatase  , IPP can be converted into 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol by removing the pyrophosphates 19. This process requires three enzymes  , including mevalonate kinase  , phosphomevalonate kinase and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase 18.MBD9 is a protein with a methyl CpG binding domain previously identified as a regulator of flowering time with potential roles in histone H4 acetylation 23 ,24. We isolated another suppressor of the extra DNA in atxr5/6 mutants  , ems_2_129  , which we mapped via whole-genome re-sequencing to a nonsense mutation at mbd9 At3g01460; Fig 4A–4D.In this study  , we demonstrated that these quantification measures used to represent methylation levels at a given genomic region could exhibit drastically different patterns when analyzed together with gene expression and histone modification signals. Finally  , the commonly-used density measure mCG/CG represents a comparison between methylated and unmethylated CpG sites in a given genomic region  , which may reflect the “competitiveness” of the region for events such as protein binding.Our previous studies showed that with these large CpG island-containing fragments  , active transcription from the endogenous promoters was maintained even upon integration into centromeric heterochromatin  , that single copy integration at different sites gave very similar levels of gene expression  , and that position effect variegation was greatly reduced 9. The divergent promoters drive expression of ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes  , encoding the TATA binding protein and proteasome component-B1 in the case of the TBP locus  , and the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 and chromobox homolog 3 in the case of the RNP locus.This study is the first to use only two-step reactions to construct a new pathway for the conversion of MVA to isoprene by combining the oleT gene from Jeotgalicoccus species and ohyA gene from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica. This process typically requires five reactions  , including a two-step phosphorylation catalyzed by mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase  , a one-step decarboxylation catalyzed by mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase  , a one-step isomerization catalyzed by IPP isomerase and a one-step dephosphorylation catalyzed by isoprene synthase 7  , 9  , 24.While these techniques are less biased in global coverage than the aforementioned methods  , they are most effective in the analysis of regions  , rather than single base resolution  , of high CpG content and methylation level. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing MeDIP-seq and Methyl-Binding Domain sequencing MBD-seq capture the methylated fraction of genomic DNA with 5-methylcytosine-specific antibodies and MBD2 protein 17–19  , respectively  , and are followed by next-generation sequencing.We also analyzed expression of an interesting DS-DM gene from the fetal brain data  , GLI4. The DS-DM in this gene is also localized to the promoter  , but there is some prior evidence that promoter methylation may normally activate transcription of NLGN2: MeCP2  , a methylated CpG-binding protein that can either activate or repress genes and associates with the transcriptional activator CREB1 27  , can bind one of the Nlgn2 promoters in mice  , and activate transcription in reporter assays 28.Sequencing yielded 4.4 to 8.6 million paired-end reads  , depending on the cell line  , and after peak calling 70 ,816 to 112 ,412 peaks were detected  , representing genomic regions methylated in the corresponding cell line. The second genome-wide DNA methylation screening methodology we applied  , to the same eight NB cell lines  , was MBD-seq: massively parallel sequencing of methylation-enriched DNA fragments  , whereby the enrichment is based on the capture of methylated sheared DNA using the high affinity of the methyl-CpG-binding domain  of the protein MBD2 towards methylated cytosines.Research in the last decade has linked the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 MeCP2 with a variety of related neurological disorders 1. Here we report the identification of such genes.Additionally  , the hypomethylation of repetitive elements can occur and leads to genomic instability 17 ,18  , and alterations in histone protein modifications can have profound consequences that contribute to cancer and define an epigenetic signature of tumorigenesis 16 ,19 ,20. This reversible addition of methyl groups at cytosines within CpG dinucleotides can promote the recruitment of protein complexes that repress transcription and also prevent the binding of transcription factors to their binding motifs 15 ,16.In addition  , single CpG loci within HDAC7 ∆beta 0.08 and HDAC10 ∆beta 0.06 were more methylated before weight loss  , with HDAC4 showing a mixed differential methylation signature  , two CpG sites hypermethylated ∆beta 0.09  , 0.10 and one hypomethylated ∆beta −0.11 before weight loss. Furthermore we observed differential methylation of one CpG in MBD4 ∆beta 0.08  , a methyl-CpG-binding domain protein and DNA glycosylase with excision activity against 5-methyl cytosine.Last  , methyltransferase enzymes themselves can show some DNA-sequence preferences 80  , 81  , and members of the methyl-binding proteins family e.g.  , MeCP2 and MBD2  , while lacking sequence-specificity  , participate in protein complexes that bind highly methylated CpG-rich sequences and can help to maintain repressive chromatin 82. 79 showed that most major classes of TFs  , including bHLH  , bZIP  , and ETS  , bind preferentially to unmethylated DNA  , whereas other TFs  , such as homeodomain  , POU  , and NFAT  , bind preferentially to methylated DNA.Transgelin  , cytoskeletal protein previously referred to as cellular biomarker of ageing 55  , demonstrated less than two-fold difference in abundance between young and old TEC. Apart from calponin 1  , other actin-binding molecules such caldesmon 1  , cortactin and palladin were also identified.A protein microarray-based approach for surveying purified human TFs revealed numerous examples  , typified by the Krüppel-like zinc-finger domain protein KLF4  , which showed methylated CpG-dependent DNA-binding activities 78. Conversely  , a group of zinc-finger TFs  , including the BTB/POZ family proteins KAISO  , ZTB4  , and ZBTB38  , as well as the Krüppel-associated box KRAB-domain TF family member ZFP57  , all recognize methylated CpGs within DNA sequence motifs and can act as repressors by perpetuating local CpG hypermethylation 77.By contrast  , unmodified CpG is recognized by proteins such as the histone lysine demethylase Kdm2a  , and Cfp1  , a protein that recruits a Setd1 H3K4 methyltransferase complex 19 ,20. For example  , 5mCpG is specifically recognized by methyl-CpG-binding proteins  , a number of which are associated with histone deacetylases and other histone-modifying enzymes 1 ,17 ,18.Relevant to hap-ASM  , in our recent work  , we used cross-species comparisons of DNA sequences and methylation patterns to test variation in CTCF-binding sites as an underlying mechanism. Similarly  , methylome mapping studies have highlighted genes that are perfectly conserved in their protein-coding sequences  , yet show significant differences in CpG methylation levels in their regulatory sequences between humans and chimpanzees 100  , 101.
