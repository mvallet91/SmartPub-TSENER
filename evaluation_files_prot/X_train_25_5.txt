However  , we found that PIP2E At2g39010  , encoding a plasma membrane aquaporin 52  , was upregulated in the salt-treated plants and that this response was stronger in the primed than in the non-primed plants. Most of these genes had very low expression levels in both primed and non-primed plants independent of whether they were treated with salt or not Additional file 1  , Table S2.Recently  , NHERF1 was reported to interact with PDGFR and PTEN phosphatase and tensin homologue mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1  , forming a ternary complex 44. The tumourigenic mutations of NHERF1 partially or completely disrupt the binding of SYK or merlin  , both of which are tumour suppressors 19 ,20 ,42 ,43  , suggesting that NHERF1 converges in a pathway mediated by the two tumour suppressors.Quantification showed that the degree of compensation is very similar among the six subunits of the RNase MRP and nuclear RNase P complexes Fig 4B. As shown in Fig 4  , we found that six of seven subunits of the RNase MRP and nuclear RNase P complexes  , NSL1 in the MIND complex  , and EMP24 in the Erp2 complex were compensated at the protein level but not at the mRNA level.ldecuk~ob calls the built-in predicate CHECK_IDENTI- l ?lCATION which manages the login of the user and provides the identification of the user @dent for the next rule that is fired. When Merlin is started by giving a user identification  , the following rule is always executed at firsti execute_job:- CHECK_IDENTIFICATIONIdent   , select_roleIdent.The re-annotation of the proteins encoded in the K. lactis CBS 2359 metabolic genome was performed in a semi-automatic manner by combining the use of the software merlin51  , developed in-house and available for download at
http://www.merlin-sysbio.org and manual inspection. In the end  , a new  , re-annotated  , GenBank file was created by merlin for each K. lactis chromosome.0PS5 adds an initial fact to the knowledge base at the beginning of the forward chaining execution  , Because of the persistence of all facts in Merlin  , Merlin does not need such a mechanism as employed in 0PS5. Note that in our approach as opposite to the RETE-algorithm the construction of that possibly complex network only happens once.The MusD/ETn family are endogenous retroviruses that are more closely related to the IAP superfamily than most other currently active mouse retroelements 33 ,34. Insertion of an ETn in the gene encodng dysferlin  , Dysf  , in A/J mice results in loss of expression and creates an orthologous gene model for human limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B 37.The main assistance which Merlin provides ita users  , is to display all software objects  , their dependencies to other software objects and the activities to be performed on all these objects in a so called working context. For example  , a module to be programmed is edited by a language sensitive editor or a module to be tested is executed by a debugger.This is a dedicated development for supporting the working context construction and update. The special and novel feature of the Merlin approach in process programming is the way how the Merlin inference engine combmes backward and forward chaining exectttion of rules.The similarity result gene product  , EC number with the highest confidence score was selected by merlin to automatically annotate each protein encoding gene of the studied genome. Using internal heuristics  , described in
51 and briefly represented above in equation 1  , merlin automatically selected a candidate annotation for each protein encoding gene of the studied genome based on confidence scores.Tonoplast Intrinsic Proteins TIPs belonging to the Major Intrinsic Protein family  , also known as the aquaporin AQP superfamily  , have been shown to conduct both water 1 and ammonia 2–4. Hence  , efficient channeling and storage of ammonia  , a central molecule in nitrogen metabolism  , is of fundamental importance.Association analysis was conducted by fitting simple regression test using the fastAssoc option in MERLIN 52. For X-chromosome analysis  , the average phenotype of males hemizygous for a particular allele was treated assumed to match the average phenotype of females homozygous for the same allele.Although merlin uses remote BLAST similarity searches to classify gene products  , the transporter information is obtained by performing local smith-waterman SW similarity alignments
56 with the TCDB  , to identify the TCS Transporter Classification Superfamily number of the genes that encode transporter proteins. An article with the detailed description of this methodology Genome-wide semi-automated annotation of transporter systems  , Dias et al.  , 2012 has been recently submitted.The FASTA method is also implemented in the --fast-Assoc option of the MERLIN 40 package  , however MERLIN calculates the kinship matrix  internally on the basis of known theoretical kinships constructed from known pedigree relationships  , rather than allowing the pairwise kinship coefficients to be estimated using genome-wide SNP genotype data 12. The mmscore and polygenic functions of the GenABEL package 39 together allow implementation of the FAmily based Score Test Approximation FASTA method proposed by Chen and Abecasis 9.Cleavable mitochondrial targeting sequences MTSs are responsible for only a small part of this length-increase of at least 0.5 MDa: The average length of the 67 known MTSs of yeast MRPs is approximately 25 residues ∼3 kDa; Vogtle et al. The total mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRP mass of each organism ranges from approximately 1.3 to 2.3 MDa  , and hence all analyzed mitoribosomes can be classified as “protein-rich ,” relative to the approximately 0.8 MDa total r-protein mass of the bacterial reference organisms E. coli and T. thermophilus.We therefore preferred to use GenABEL  , which can read in a user-specified matrix  constructed on the basis of either theoretical or estimated kinship coefficients. The FASTA method is also implemented in the --fast-Assoc option of the MERLIN 40 package  , however MERLIN calculates the kinship matrix  internally on the basis of known theoretical kinships constructed from known pedigree relationships  , rather than allowing the pairwise kinship coefficients to be estimated using genome-wide SNP genotype data 12.We also analyzed allele sharing and determined non-penetrant individuals using the tools pediSNP and SNPduo Supplementary Figure 2 in Text S1. We selected ∼2% of the genotyped SNPs 10 ,763 autosomal SNPs  , requiring that they were heterozygous in at least 4 genotyped individuals  , and used them for parametric linkage as calculated with the Merlin linkage analysis software 21 assuming a dominant model with reduced penetrance set at 0.8.The remaining eight clusters contain two hypothetical proteins  , an aminopeptidase  , a kinase  , a reductase  , a pyrimidine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase  , cardiolipin synthetase  , and uracil-DNA-glycosylase. 2006  , the enzymes fructose-bisphosphate aldolase  , 3-dehydroquinate and pantothenate kinase  , as well as bioC and csrA that have paralogs both within Coxiella and Legionella.Furthermore  , the unique feature of combining different rule syntax based on different underlying executicm paradigms represents a first step towards a multi-paradigm language for process modelling as for example described in DGS89b . The main advantages and key distinguishing features of the Merlin approach as compared to other ruldmed process-centered software development environments like MARVEL KBFS88 or OIKOS ACM90  , are the persistent storage of a process combined with its efficient and flexible interpretation of backward and forward chaining rules.This connection between the rule call and the heads of the corresponding rules is the main mason for the efficient execution of the Merlin backward chaining rules. 6.1.The translucent supernatant was then supplemented with 2 mM GTP  , 10 pM taxol  , 1 U/ml hexokinase  , 50 mM glucose  , and 25–50 nm AMP-PNP and incubated on ice for 90 min for microtubule polymerization. The supernatant was centrifuged at 150 ,000xg for 60 min and the pellet discarded.The tumourigenic mutations of NHERF1 partially or completely disrupt the binding of SYK or merlin  , both of which are tumour suppressors 19 ,20 ,42 ,43  , suggesting that NHERF1 converges in a pathway mediated by the two tumour suppressors. We reported earlier that NHERF1 interacted with SYK and merlin 1.Pantothenate kinase catalyzes the first step in coenzyme A synthesis. Pantothenic acid is a component of coenzyme A  , the acetylated form of which plays a key role in the citric acid cycle.Hence  , two projects were initiated with merlin  , allowing the software tool to use all data available in the NCBI database nrDB to annotate the Kluyveromyces lactis genome in the first project  , while for the later project only data from the NCBI’s yeastDB were used. Thus  , the baker’s yeast was selected as a reference organism for the EC numbers annotation because the two microorganisms share the phylogenetic lineage all the way to the taxonomic family level and S. cerevisiae is the best studied  , annotated and curated Fungus.Accessing finqqained information via path names is tedious and inefficient compared to an associative query access like " AU facts with time stamp 11/05/92 " which is provided by the Merlin data base. via directory path names at least if the update of that information is done immediately  , which is necessary be cause of the requirements given in section 3 of this paper.The species in the family Iridoviridae are: Invertebrate iridescent virus 6 IIV_6  , NC_003038 in genus Iridovirus; Lymphocystis disease virus - isolate China LCDV_IC  , NC_005902 and Lymphocystis disease virus 1 LCDV_1  , NC_001824 in genus Lymphocystivirus; Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus ISaKNV  , NC_003494 in genus Megalocytivirus; Frog virus 3 FV_3  , NC_005946  , Regina ranavirus ATV  , NC_005832 and Singapore grouper iridovirus SiGV  , NC_006549 in genus Ranavirus.

In Merlin we employ a patiicular extension of abstract syntax graphs which are now described in detail.Analyses were carried out using a score test implemented in the Merlin software. Associations in the TwinsUK set were tested on the combined sample of GWAS and replication genotypes  , for all samples with skeletal measurements available n = 2 ,375.As already sketched in the introduction  , a user's working context in Merlin consists of all objects which according to their access rights have been granted to the user upfront or during execution of the software process  , i.e. 2.1 for an example of a working context of a user called Miller who performs the role of a programmer.To select the corresponding rule head for the current rule call Merlin performs at most 3 accesses to the database. This connection between the rule call and the heads of the corresponding rules is the main mason for the efficient execution of the Merlin backward chaining rules.The transported metabolites analysis to be published together with the transports classification methodology in Genome-wide semi-automated annotation of transporter systems  , Dias et al.  , 2012  , provided by merlin  , confirms that such gene facilitates the efflux of sodium ions  , among the transport of other cations. The protein was annotated by the enzyme commission with the EC number 3.6.3.7 Na + exporting ATPase and in the transporter classification database as belonging to the 3.A.3 P-type ATPase P-ATPase Superfamily 3.A.3.#.#  , which includes proteins that promote cations  , such as sodium  , exchange or efflux.Similarly to Merlin  , OIKOS ACM90  exploits the PRO- LOG backtracking mechanism and even allows parallel execution of rule chains thus modelling concurrent work of developers. For efficiency reasons alone but also for modelling reasons it is impossible to map abstract syntax graph-like structures to UNIX-directories.Current work in Merlin focttsses on a sophisticated transaction management concept  , which is based on a special combination of optimistic and pessimistic protocols  , and which should support different team structures. In particular  , it was illustrated how appropriate data base support provides a solution for problems like error recovery  , transaction management  , and the construction of a process engineez's support environment.The total mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRP mass of each organism ranges from approximately 1.3 to 2.3 MDa  , and hence all analyzed mitoribosomes can be classified as “protein-rich ,” relative to the approximately 0.8 MDa total r-protein mass of the bacterial reference organisms E. coli and T. thermophilus. 2007.Thus  , the baker’s yeast was selected as a reference organism for the EC numbers annotation because the two microorganisms share the phylogenetic lineage all the way to the taxonomic family level and S. cerevisiae is the best studied  , annotated and curated Fungus. Indeed  , whenever a Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue was available  , merlin would consistently select the baker’s yeast gene annotation to annotate the Kluyveromyces lactis gene.Alox12  , Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase; Casp6  , Caspase 6; Matn2  , Matrilin 2; Ptplb  , Protein tyrosine phosphatase-like B; Sox21  , SRY sex determining region Y-box 21; Spock2  , Sparc/osteonectin  , CWCV  , and Kazal-like domains proteoglycan testican 2; Tesc  , Tescalcin; Tpm2  , Tropomysin 2; Wif1  , WNT inhibitory factor; Stmn1  , stathmin 1; Ptp4a2  , phosphatase 4a2. All nine patterns detected in the microarray set were validated by the qRT-PCR results.Using this information  , a process-centered software development environment like Merlin can provide maximum information to developexx or manage~ resp. This prototype  , for simplicity also called Merlin in the remainder of this paper  , uses a rule-based technique to describe software process*Merlin is not an acronym Merlin stands for the idea to support sotiare construction based on a well-defined set of building blocks of software and their respective attributes and relations.Analyses were performed using the easyLINKAGE and easyLINKAGE-Plus tools 29 ,30. The two-point and multipoint linkage analyses Genehunter 26  , Allegro 27 and Merlin 28 were performed assuming a fully penetrant autosomal recessive trait with a disease frequency of 0.001 and no phenocopies.In section 3 the requirements for a process agine resulting from the functionality sketched in section 2 are outlined. In the next section we give a brief example of the Merlin user interface.This methodology was also developed in-house and will be included in merlin’s 2.0 version. Although merlin uses remote BLAST similarity searches to classify gene products  , the transporter information is obtained by performing local smith-waterman SW similarity alignments
56 with the TCDB  , to identify the TCS Transporter Classification Superfamily number of the genes that encode transporter proteins.Moreover  , merlin’s interface was used throughout the reannotation process to assign functions and protein names to each metabolic gene. merlin allows exporting the annotation as an Excel file or in the GenBank format  , during or after the end of the annotation process.The notable Merlin extensions include firstly to organise rules in clusters. 'he information about the rule call  , the backtrack points  , the variable list  , the variable names  , and the current bindings are kept in main memory.The special and novel feature of the Merlin approach in process programming is the way how the Merlin inference engine combmes backward and forward chaining exectttion of rules. Again the examples in this section should illustrate this point.Each cluster contains a list of rules who have ideatical names  , i.e. The notable Merlin extensions include firstly to organise rules in clusters.Out of the 5085 genes available on the GenBank fasta files provided to merlin  , 2000 genes were revised. Figure
4 discretises the main outcomes of this process.Throughout this work  , some enzymes encoded in the milk yeast genome were identified and classified with both EC and TCS numbers. The transported metabolites analysis to be published together with the transports classification methodology in Genome-wide semi-automated annotation of transporter systems  , Dias et al.  , 2012  , provided by merlin  , confirms that such gene facilitates the efflux of sodium ions  , among the transport of other cations.AQP9 encodes aquaporin 9  , a liver glycerol channel 40  , and contains variants which showed association with metabolic networks 1 and 2 top metabolites: triglycerides in very large HDL and mean diameter of VLDL as well as networks 3 and 4 top metabolites: mean diameter of HDL and phosphatidylcholine. Further  , AQP9 mice have previously been shown to have elevated levels of plasma glycerol and triglycerides  , and inhibition of AQP9 by a small molecule inhibitor showed that it is required for glycerol-dependent glucose production in murine hepatocytes 42  , 43.A working context in Merlin is displayed on the screen in a hypertext-like manner as follows objects are represented as boxes  , the boxes have menus attached at the upper right comer which contain the activities which could be and/or have to be performed on the objects. Finally  , a working context displays the dependencies between the different objects.Association analysis on the imputed genotype probabilities was performed using Merlin 33. After filtering  , 6 ,005 ,138 SNPs remained for further analysis.Using internal heuristics  , described in
51 and briefly represented above in equation 1  , merlin automatically selected a candidate annotation for each protein encoding gene of the studied genome based on confidence scores. Moreover  , merlin reduced the curation efforts  , as it allows the user to browse through all similarity search results and change the automatic annotations provided by the software.Interestingly  , four kinases were identified hexokinase 1 HK1  , hexokinase 2 HK2  , pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cells PKLR  , and phosphofructose kinase liver PKFL  , which regulate irreversible steps of the glycolysis pathway Figure 3. Of the group of kinases that were identified as hits  , the majority of them are serine/threonine kinases 33 of 83  , whereas fewer belonged to the tyrosine kinase 10 of 83  , lipid kinase four of 83  , or sugar/metabolism kinase 12 of 83 families.In these experiments  , control and aquaporin-expressing oocytes were exposed to isotonic solutions containing 160 mM of the respective solutes and changes in oocyte volume were recorded during 1 min. The permeability of X. laevis oocytes expressing HsAQP3 or zebrafish GLPs to the cryoprotectants glycerol  , propylene glycol and ethylene glycol PGly  , PPG and PEG  , respectively at different pH was determined volumetrically.The annotated genome of this organism brings some new insights on its capabilities and allowed the reconstruction of the Kluyveromyces lactis genome-scale metabolic model currently being finalized. The re-annotation of the proteins encoded in the K. lactis CBS 2359 metabolic genome was performed in a semi-automatic manner by combining the use of the software merlin51  , developed in-house and available for download at
http://www.merlin-sysbio.org and manual inspection.Extracts were prepared from 0- to 1-  , 1- to 2- and 2- to 3-hour old wild-type and smaug-mutant embryos and assayed for A hexokinase activity or B phosphofructokinase activity. Glycolytic enzymes are overexpressed in -mutant embryos.merlin provides a numeric confidence score for each automatic assignment  , taking into account the frequency and the taxonomy within the annotations of all sequences that are similar to the gene under investigation
51  , according to equation 1: The reconstruction process cannot begin without a functionally annotated genome; thus  , merlin performs automatic genome-wide functional reannotations  , by comparing biological sequences from the organism being studied with all of the NCBI’s databases.As it does not offer support for various locking modes on different levels of granularity and as it has no appropriate support for distribution and multi-user access we are cmently porting the Merlin system to a fully object-oriented system. section 5 does offer very sophisticated facilities for storing and retrieving fin~grained information items  , we selected it as the basis for our first implementation.MLINK of the FASTLINK package was used to perform two-point linkage analysis. The genotype data was screened for Mendelian incompatibilities using PEDCHECK  , while MERLIN was used to assess the data for occurrence of double recombination events over short genetic distances  , which are most likely due to genotyping error.In traditional rule implementations the database has to be accessed for every rule until the corresponding rule is found. To select the corresponding rule head for the current rule call Merlin performs at most 3 accesses to the database.As an example  , let us describe the rules executed for a programmers session in Merlin. This rule is select_roe which identifies all roles the user may perform.Every rule in a forward chaining cluster whose preconditions are fulfilled  , is executed. Interpretation of forward chaining rules 'l%e interpretation of the Merlin forward chaining rules is simple.Such algorithm classified the TC family numbers and metabolites associated to each TPGC  , using the taxonomy of each of the TCDB homologue genes and the frequency of the TC family numbers or metabolites  , within all similar genes. Thus  , the TC family numbers  , as well as the metabolites  , of the TCDB genes similar to each TPGC were classified with the same algorithm used by merlin to classify the EC numbers of each EEGC.Associations with z-scores for the EPIC  , Rotterdam and 1958 Birth Cohort were tested using a generalised linear model 1df assuming an additive effect for the presence of each additional minor allele. GW-association analysis in the TwinsUK sample was carried out using a score test and variance components to account for twin status  , implemented in the Merlin software package 50.The proximity of AQP9 to the well-known LIPC gene 250 Kb downstream raises the question of whether the AQP9 and LIPC loci harbour independent effects. AQP9 encodes aquaporin 9  , a liver glycerol channel 40  , and contains variants which showed association with metabolic networks 1 and 2 top metabolites: triglycerides in very large HDL and mean diameter of VLDL as well as networks 3 and 4 top metabolites: mean diameter of HDL and phosphatidylcholine.Ccxwerning database support  , the MARVEL system uses a special purpose adaption of the UNIX directory structure cf. Accessing finqqained information via path names is tedious and inefficient compared to an associative query access like " AU facts with time stamp 11/05/92 " which is provided by the Merlin data base.We used the nearest marker at each binding site to estimate IBD for the 15 possible sib pairs. We then used MERLIN 61 to filter out improbable genotypes and compute IBD at our marker locations option “–ibd”.to suppott them to perform activities in the software process. Using this information  , a process-centered software development environment like Merlin can provide maximum information to developexx or manage~ resp.In addition  , the way how Merlin stores its forward chaining rides in GRAS ~ovides the information about the conflict set. 1 L~t = R List = W List = X Var = Doz.- Ver = De&Name Var = New_Statm  During the above described execution of a forward chaining rule cluster  , the access to the global parameter list is done exploiting the EParam  , EElem and the ECorrParam edges  , analogously to the execution of backward chaining rules.Cooperation is achieved via a blackboardlike communication mechanism between rule chains. Similarly to Merlin  , OIKOS ACM90  exploits the PRO- LOG backtracking mechanism and even allows parallel execution of rule chains thus modelling concurrent work of developers.The status information about an object which is needed to update the working contexts  , is requested from the user by Merlin  , Whenev= a user finishes an activity. new activities can be perfrxmed on objects.Thus  , all genes that had one or more transmembrane helices were considered transporter protein encoding gene candidates TPGC and were aligned to the TCDB. Moreover  , merlin uses internal heuristics to lower the threshold  , inversely to the number of transmembrane helices of the gene.Sequence features determined for HvABCC2 include tm1 through tm12: transmembrane domains as predicted by Phobius 81. Hv-YHD3 is the predicted protein sequence of the YHD3 exon 2 frameshift mutant GenBank GQ332572; HvABCC2 is from the YFO strain of Heliothis virescens GQ332571; HsABCC2 is from Heliothis subflexa GQ332573; BmABCC2 is from Bombyx mori; CG4562 is isoform A of CG4562 from Drosophila melanogaster AAF44707; AAI50823 is ATP-binding cassette  , sub-family C CFTR/MRP from Mus musculus AAI50823.Polycomb repressive complex 2 PRC2 trimethylates histone H3 on lysine 27  , a mark that is associated with transcriptional silencing 60. Likewise  , because of enrichment for the GO term ‘glucose metabolic process’ and the KEGG pathway ‘glycolysis/gluconeogenesis’  , we assayed hexokinase  , the first enzyme in glycolysis  , and phosphofructokinase  , which represents a critical point of regulation 58 ,59 and catalyzes the committed step of glycolysis that is  , the product of this reaction serves solely as a precursor to the final product of the glycolytic pathway.All of these proteins limit growth by mediating the phosphorylation and cytosolic retention of the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie Yki/YES Associated Protein YAP 9 ,11  , preventing Yki from up-regulating genes that promote growth 9 ,13 ,14. This pathway includes the Warts Wts and Hippo Hpo kinases  , the FERM domain proteins Expanded Ex and Merlin Mer  , and the accessory proteins Salvador Sav and Mob-as-tumor-suppressor Mats.Section 5 describes the &ta model and the underlying data base used to manipulate the Merlin knowledge base. Section 5 and 6 are the focus of this paper.1 Merlin 35 is similar to MARVEL  , but employs two distinct styles of rules: Backward chaining on logic programming rules establish which process steps are currently valid in the user's current roles  , and then forward chaining on planning system rules guides the user through an automated process sequence. Synchronization is implicit in data access  , since MARVEL 3.0 enforces serializability among concurrent consistency chains and automation rules 6.We analyzed a recently released Java Buffer library  , JDK 1.4 Merlin and found many redundancies – the same or very similar code fragments recurring in may places. Yet  , programs are often polluted by redundant code.The two other paralog sets were  , firstly  , fructose-biphosphate aldolase and  , secondly  , beta-glucosidase  , lactase phlorizinhydrolase and related proteins. The four paralog sets identified two proteins that we previously identified as IIS regulated in worms and flies: pantothenate kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.When Merlin is started by giving a user identification  , the following rule is always executed at firsti execute_job:- CHECK_IDENTIFICATIONIdent   , select_roleIdent. As an example  , let us describe the rules executed for a programmers session in Merlin.After 1 min including zero time for subtraction of the signal from externally bound solute  , oocytes were washed rapidly in ice-cold MBS three times  , and individual oocytes were dissolved for at least 1 h in 400 μl of 10% SDS for scintillation counting. Under isotonic conditions  , groups of 10 oocytes injected with water or aquaporin cRNA were incubated in 200 μl of isotonic MBS at different pH containing 5 μM 20 μCi 1 ,2-3Hethylene glycol  , and cold ethylene glycol was added to give 1 mM final concentration.The PROLOG backward chaining combined with backtracking wMch is btilt into the inference engine  , allows to describe the information retrieval algorithm necessary to construct a working context in a highly condensed way  , Information retrieval means to check a usually large number of highly nested preconditions which depend on each other and basically define certain object states as the preconditions to perform certain activities. CM84 which we exploit in Merlin as well  , avoids to specify a lot of exwution control constraints.When the first automatic annotation results were analysed  , a pattern emerged. Each K. lactis gene assigned by merlin with enzymatic functions on either the first or the second similarity search was labelled as an enzyme encoding gene candidate EEGC.In general   , one of the major work areas in the Merlin project is to investigate the power and suitability of fully object oriented database systems as the underlying storage mechanism for process-centered software development environments. As it does not offer support for various locking modes on different levels of granularity and as it has no appropriate support for distribution and multi-user access we are cmently porting the Merlin system to a fully object-oriented system.Software objects are objects of any granularity that are produced during the software development process  , e.g. The wizard Merlin is supposed to have built the Stonehenge in southern Ihgtand a set of welldefirmd building blocks and relations and the wizard was able to foresee the future at least to a certain extent such that king Roles represent groups of activities which are logically highly related.We reported earlier that NHERF1 interacted with SYK and merlin 1. Although our study addressed the biologic effect of NHERF1 on the proliferation of breast cancer cells  , it remains unclear which NHERF1-associated pathway  , among all NHERF1-interacting partners  , is responsible for the NHERF1 tumour suppressor function.The reconstruction process cannot begin without a functionally annotated genome; thus  , merlin performs automatic genome-wide functional reannotations  , by comparing biological sequences from the organism being studied with all of the NCBI’s databases. merlin51 is a software tool  , in continuous development  , created to assist on the process of reconstructing a genome-scale metabolic model.For that purpose  , the main criteria were  , in first priority  , the existence of information in curated databases for the K. lactis genes and  , in second priority  , the existence of curated S. cerevisiae homologues. Despite using merlin  , all of the Kluyveromyces lactis functional EEGC’s automatic assignments were reviewed according to the schema depicted in Figure
3  , so that the minimum number of false positives would be included in this annotation.Notably  , more than 80% of NF2 mutations are located in this ERM domain 23  , and the mutant merlin proteins display significantly lower binding affinity to NHERF1  , suggesting that NHERF1 is related to merlin's suppressor activity. Like other ERM members  , merlin interacts with NHERF1 through its amino-terminus ERM domain.Moreover  , merlin reduced the curation efforts  , as it allows the user to browse through all similarity search results and change the automatic annotations provided by the software. The similarity result gene product  , EC number with the highest confidence score was selected by merlin to automatically annotate each protein encoding gene of the studied genome.Like other ERM members  , merlin interacts with NHERF1 through its amino-terminus ERM domain. The interaction may be important for NHERF1 functions by connecting membrane transporters and actin cytoskeleton 21 ,22.Thus  , the TC family numbers  , as well as the metabolites  , of the TCDB genes similar to each TPGC were classified with the same algorithm used by merlin to classify the EC numbers of each EEGC. A TPGC can have similarities to different families and super-families of the same TC class that can nevertheless have similar functions.'l%emfom  , Merlin starts the rule interpretation with the first rule in a forward chaining rule cluster whose preconditions are fulfilled. Every forwmd chaining rule of a cluster has to be tested at least once.This prototype  , for simplicity also called Merlin in the remainder of this paper  , uses a rule-based technique to describe software process*Merlin is not an acronym Merlin stands for the idea to support sotiare construction based on a well-defined set of building blocks of software and their respective attributes and relations. In the context of the Merlin* project carried out at the University of Dortmund in cooperation with STZ  , a Dortmund based software house  , a prototype of a process-centered environment has been completed.The new annotation proposed in this work could only be accomplished as merlin provided semi-automatic scored results. The metabolic genes could be exclusively enzymatic 1410 genes  , transporter proteins 301 genes or have both metabolic activities 48 genes.DGS89aAs  , however  , the integration of a process engineer's sup port environment into Merlin is planned  , the requirements for such an environment concerning the storage and manipulation of a software process definition  , have significantly influenced the construction of the Merlii data base which is one of the main topics of this paper cf. As an extension of our own work  , a prototype of such a process engineer's support environment has been developed within the MELMAC project cf.The predicted topology of each protein detailed in Table 6 is also largely comparable between the two yeast species. The C. albicans ABC proteins fall neatly into the categories developed for S. cerevisiae  , and they are also present in approximately the same numbers with the exception of the MRP/CFTR subfamily; see below.It was the group of genes assigned with different enzymes on each merlin project distinct. The third set of genes was the most troublesome.To avoid such massive effort  , merlin was used to implement the remote similarity alignments between the user set of genes or full genome as was the case and the previously selected remote NCBI database  , as well as retrieve and classify each homologue’s annotation  , providing comprehensible information. Anyone that has tried one of the many BLAST search tools available in the internet such as
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi or
http://www.UniProt.org/blast/ knows that the output of a BLAST search is not much helpful for the collection of metabolic data see Additional file
1: Figure S2 of the supplemental material  , because the user has to follow several links to retrieve the data: to retrieve metabolic data  , the user has to go over all identified homologue genes  , retrieve enzymatic information and compile such information for all genes of the studied genome.In addition  , such a data model as used in Merlin and a data base supporting that model provide a straightforward solution to integrate the syntax-directed tools of a process engineer's support environment. This makes it very tedious to express necessary sequencing of activities and explicit ce ordination of concurrency which is usually not available in basic blackboard systems.The results showed that the genes including glucose transporter 3 GLUT3  , hexokinase 1 HK1  , phosphoglycerate kinase 2 PGK2  , pyruvate kinase M PKM  , and lactate dehydrogenase A LDHA were induced by hypoxia and knockdown of TET1 or INSIG1 abolished or decreased their expression levels in two different cell lines Figure 4a ,b  , and Additional file 11a ,b. The genes in the glucose metabolism pathway were tested for their expression under hypoxia and knockdown of TET1 or INSIG1.The Common Lisp Framework CLF 11 incorporates AP5 rules with data-driven forward chaining. 1 Merlin 35 is similar to MARVEL  , but employs two distinct styles of rules: Backward chaining on logic programming rules establish which process steps are currently valid in the user's current roles  , and then forward chaining on planning system rules guides the user through an automated process sequence.Hv-YHD3 is the predicted protein sequence of the YHD3 exon 2 frameshift mutant GenBank GQ332572; HvABCC2 is from the YFO strain of Heliothis virescens GQ332571; HsABCC2 is from Heliothis subflexa GQ332573; BmABCC2 is from Bombyx mori; CG4562 is isoform A of CG4562 from Drosophila melanogaster AAF44707; AAI50823 is ATP-binding cassette  , sub-family C CFTR/MRP from Mus musculus AAI50823. Boxed regions are A/P: Walker A motif/P-loop; Q: Q-loop/lid; C: ABC transporter signature motif; B: Walker B motif; D: D-loop; H: H-loop/switch region 82.1 L~t = R List = W List = X Var = Doz.- Ver = De&Name Var = New_Statm  During the above described execution of a forward chaining rule cluster  , the access to the global parameter list is done exploiting the EParam  , EElem and the ECorrParam edges  , analogously to the execution of backward chaining rules. 'l%emfom  , Merlin starts the rule interpretation with the first rule in a forward chaining rule cluster whose preconditions are fulfilled.These approximate tests have been implemented in various software packages including MERLIN  , GenABEL  , EMMAX  , TASSEL  , FaST-LMM  , Mendel and MMM. These computational considerations have led to the development of several faster approximations for constructing tests of the fixed SNP effects of interest in the linear mixed model 1  , 2  , 9  , 10  , 14.To retrieve enzymatic information  , merlin performs remote BLAST similarity searches to the NCBI databases. To avoid such massive effort  , merlin was used to implement the remote similarity alignments between the user set of genes or full genome as was the case and the previously selected remote NCBI database  , as well as retrieve and classify each homologue’s annotation  , providing comprehensible information.As argued in section 5  , the data model supports syntax-directed editing  , analysing  , and with some extensions simulation of our ride-based process definitions. In addition  , such a data model as used in Merlin and a data base supporting that model provide a straightforward solution to integrate the syntax-directed tools of a process engineer's support environment.Associations in the Chuvasha sample were tested using pedigree disequilibrium test PDT 54. Analyses were carried out using a score test implemented in the Merlin software.In principle  , constructing and refreshing working contexts are based on the definition of activities and corresponding objects which are manipulated by performing the activities . The process engine is that part of the Merlin ezwironment which enables to define a software process in an executable language and which builds and refreshes user's working contexts by executing the given process definition.Derived from the context free definition of the Merlin de language  , each rule is stored in an abstract syntax tree-like way. 5 .1 the abstract syntax tree notation of a single backward chaining rule is given as a simple example.The main advantages and key distinguishing features of the Merlin approach as compared to other ruldmed process-centered software development environments like MARVEL KBFS88 or OIKOS ACM90  , are the persistent storage of a process combined with its efficient and flexible interpretation of backward and forward chaining rules. We  , therefore  , compare our approach with other approaches which also use a rule-based formalism .Interpretation of forward chaining rules 'l%e interpretation of the Merlin forward chaining rules is simple. The next rule to be unified is either the first body element of the rule that has been selected during the last resolution step or if the selected rule was a fact  , the next rule to be unified is the next rule in the body.The same information is provided in the RETEalgorithm by always updating a network of rule conditions whenever one particular rule is executed. In addition  , the way how Merlin stores its forward chaining rides in GRAS ~ovides the information about the conflict set.We selected ∼2% of the genotyped SNPs 10 ,763 autosomal SNPs  , requiring that they were heterozygous in at least 4 genotyped individuals  , and used them for parametric linkage as calculated with the Merlin linkage analysis software 21 assuming a dominant model with reduced penetrance set at 0.8. In preparation for interpreting the results of our WGS  , we performed linkage analysis on Pedigree 1 Figure 2A by genotyping 7 family members using the Illumina HumanHap 550 Genotyping BeadChip v1.0 and 5 family members with Illumina Human 610-Quad v1.0 Genotyping BeadChip.To elucidate the global functions of Smaug in early embryos we employed two genome-wide approaches: 1 RNA co-immunoprecipitations followed by microarray analysis RIP-Chip to identify mRNAs that are bound by Smaug and 2 polysome gradients coupled to microarrays to identify targets of Smaug-mediated translational repression. We present data indicating that Smaug regulates the expression of mRNAs encoding glycolytic enzymes hexokinase and phosophofructokinase  , a proteasome regulatory subunit Rpn7 as well as epigenetic Suz12 and post-transcriptional Bicaudal C regulators.Indeed  , whenever a Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue was available  , merlin would consistently select the baker’s yeast gene annotation to annotate the Kluyveromyces lactis gene. The homologues’ taxonomic distribution was  , as it will be shown in the Results section  , biased.Alignments showing homologous regions of one or more representatives of each major group found in D. pulex with those from various taxa reveal conserved motifs in protein-coding regions Additional file 3a-j  , such as those with predicted catalytic function for example  , hAT  , PIF/Harbinger  , Merlin  , P  , and Tc1/mariner 15-18 or polymerase activity for example  , Maverick 19. Membership of each complete TE identified to a given superfamily was validated by verifying the presence of the structural characteristic features of that superfamily 12.Insertion of an ETn in the gene encodng dysferlin  , Dysf  , in A/J mice results in loss of expression and creates an orthologous gene model for human limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B 37. Loss of Zhx2 expression in BALB/cJ but not other BALB/c lines due to an ETn-II insertion results in persistent Afp expression into adulthood 35 ,36.Moreover  , merlin uses internal heuristics to lower the threshold  , inversely to the number of transmembrane helices of the gene. The similarity threshold  , when performing the SW similarity searches  , was of 10%  , because the transporter database was very small 6100 records at the time of the alignment – September 2011.This concept reduces the usually large lists of activities and functions offered by non process-guided software development environments to comprehensible detailed " to-do-lists " which are updated online based on the progress of a software project. The main assistance which Merlin provides ita users  , is to display all software objects  , their dependencies to other software objects and the activities to be performed on all these objects in a so called working context.Under isotonic conditions  , groups of 10 oocytes injected with water or aquaporin cRNA were incubated in 200 μl of isotonic MBS at different pH containing 5 μM 20 μCi 1 ,2-3Hethylene glycol  , and cold ethylene glycol was added to give 1 mM final concentration. The uptake of 1 ,2-3Hethylene glycol American Radiolabelled Chemicals Inc.; 20 Ci/mmol was determined in oocytes exposed to isotonic and hypertonic solutions at room temperature.For example  , several genes involved in cancer-associated glycolysis and lipogenesis Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha Acaca  , ATP citrate lyase Acly  , and Hexokinase 2 Hk2 are upregulated in the mammary tissue of socially isolated mice 24. One of the greatest advantages of using mouse models to study BC is the ability to isolate specific cellular components within the tumor microenvironment.Of the test genes  , RNAi of only one  , the pantothenate kinase pnk-1  , significantly shortened lifespan. As a positive control we performed RNAi using daf-16 which  , as expected  , resulted in a large decrease in lifespan 57%.It is worthwhile to note that the Merlin rulebased descri~ tion mechanism allows ample flexibility to customize an environment towards particular company's or even project's needs. 2PSW92  , The example is based on the ISPW6/7 scenario as defined in KFFK91.In the context of the Merlin* project carried out at the University of Dortmund in cooperation with STZ  , a Dortmund based software house  , a prototype of a process-centered environment has been completed. 'l%& idea relates to the old english fairy tale about King-Arthur.merlin allows exporting the annotation as an Excel file or in the GenBank format  , during or after the end of the annotation process. merlin’s interface is particularly user friendly  , providing “drop down boxes” see Additional file
1: Figure S1 of the supplemental material for the annotation of each gene.The proteins encoded in the Kluyveromyces lactis complete metabolic genome were annotated  , systematically  , throughout this work. Out of the 5085 genes available on the GenBank fasta files provided to merlin  , 2000 genes were revised.The interpretation algorithm based on the introduced storage representation is outlined in section 6. Section 5 describes the &ta model and the underlying data base used to manipulate the Merlin knowledge base.In conclusion  , the transcriptional response to reduced IIS shows very little evolutionary conservation at the level of gene orthology. Pantothenate kinase catalyzes the first step in coenzyme A synthesis.Multidrug-Resistance like Protein 1 MRP contains two mutually exclusive exons in cluster 1 and eight mutually exclusive exons in cluster 2  , and can generate 16 possible isoforms Fig. 1a.In the next section we give a brief example of the Merlin user interface. Section 7 gives an overview about related work and section 8 outlines current and future work.Taking into account that metazoa appeared long after the first eukaryotes  , the combined analysis of MRP- and rRNA data indicates that the constructive phase of mitoribosomal protein M-RP-gain largely occurred before the reductive phase of rRNA-loss: The mitoribosome first acquired numerous MS-RPs early in eukaryote evolution  , converting it from “rRNA-rich but protein-poor” as in bacteria to “rRNA-rich and protein-rich.” Plants  , fungi  , protests  , and most algae have retained such rRNA-rich mitoribosomes. And thus  , the well-characterized mammalian “rRNA-poor and protein-rich” 55S mitoribosome is not representative for eukaryotes  , but rather exceptional.Such results were then reviewed in other databases such as UniProt or BRENDA to maximize the confidence in the results. The new annotation proposed in this work could only be accomplished as merlin provided semi-automatic scored results.Such collection was carefully reviewed  , with the purpose of selecting the correct gene function without reservations. It was the group of genes assigned with different enzymes on each merlin project distinct.The Merlin system consists of a multithreaded page server and a C ?+ library that provides the client run time system  , including basic components like storage manager and page buffer. The query engine is based on the Merlin client/server storage system Ger96 .Labeled arrows between the boxes describe the relations between objects . A working context in Merlin is displayed on the screen in a hypertext-like manner as follows objects are represented as boxes  , the boxes have menus attached at the upper right comer which contain the activities which could be and/or have to be performed on the objects.Furthermore  , the social modulation of these glycolytic and lipogenic pathways is amplified in mammary adipocytes relative to non-adipocyte cell populations 57. For example  , several genes involved in cancer-associated glycolysis and lipogenesis Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha Acaca  , ATP citrate lyase Acly  , and Hexokinase 2 Hk2 are upregulated in the mammary tissue of socially isolated mice 24.In Merlin we employ a patiicular extension of abstract syntax graphs which are now described in detail. lW&l  , but these approaches are compilative approaches and they do not support therequirement for changes on the fly as well automatically storage of changes.However  , 48 genes identified as transporter systems encoding genes were also annotated by the annotation pipeline with EC numbers. The annotation pipeline for genes that encode enzymes described on Figure
3 of the Methods section reviewed a total of 1699 EEGC’s and the transporter annotation function within merlin provided 349 genes.This enables to keep @nters to potentially executable rules analogous to the ECorrRule edges in Merlin cf. KBFS88 .The genotype data was screened for Mendelian incompatibilities using PEDCHECK  , while MERLIN was used to assess the data for occurrence of double recombination events over short genetic distances  , which are most likely due to genotyping error. The average genotype call rate obtained for the 45 birds in the study was 99.37% range 98.32–99.74% providing approximately 2661 genotypes per bird.Some others like MACE 5 or YUMA 6  adopt a collaborative annotation paradigm for metadata enrichment. Some projects for instance  , MIMO-DB 3 or MERLIN 4  relate CH objects with terms of an external authority or vocabulary.A further major effort is geared towards the development of a sophisticated process engineer's support erwironment. In general   , one of the major work areas in the Merlin project is to investigate the power and suitability of fully object oriented database systems as the underlying storage mechanism for process-centered software development environments.The Mutator superfamily representatives in the D. pulex genome all shared high levels of similarity with a recently discovered subgroup called Phantom 20; Additional file 3f. Alignments showing homologous regions of one or more representatives of each major group found in D. pulex with those from various taxa reveal conserved motifs in protein-coding regions Additional file 3a-j  , such as those with predicted catalytic function for example  , hAT  , PIF/Harbinger  , Merlin  , P  , and Tc1/mariner 15-18 or polymerase activity for example  , Maverick 19.With XVCL  , we generated the same Buffer library classes from compact  , non-redundant meta-components whose size  , in LOC  , is just 40% of the original library. We analyzed a recently released Java Buffer library  , JDK 1.4 Merlin and found many redundancies – the same or very similar code fragments recurring in may places.Only much later  , that is  , early in metazoan evolution  , the reduction of rRNA was initiated that resulted in protein-rich mitoribosomes with varying degrees of rRNA poverty. Taking into account that metazoa appeared long after the first eukaryotes  , the combined analysis of MRP- and rRNA data indicates that the constructive phase of mitoribosomal protein M-RP-gain largely occurred before the reductive phase of rRNA-loss: The mitoribosome first acquired numerous MS-RPs early in eukaryote evolution  , converting it from “rRNA-rich but protein-poor” as in bacteria to “rRNA-rich and protein-rich.” Plants  , fungi  , protests  , and most algae have retained such rRNA-rich mitoribosomes.The molecule was first described as effective in animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD 3  , and the developers subsequently reported improvements in protein production in models of cystic fibrosis CF 4 and dysferlin deficiency 5. Such a molecule would be applicable to a wide range of incurable hereditary diseases and some forms of cancer.MAEL is a protein of unknown biochemical function with a non-canonical HMG-box and a unique domain homologous to the DnaQ-H 3′-5′ exonuclease 27. Previous studies have shown that mutations in fruit fly and mouse Maelstrom Mael genes derepress transposons 25 ,26.2006  , the enzymes fructose-bisphosphate aldolase  , 3-dehydroquinate and pantothenate kinase  , as well as bioC and csrA that have paralogs both within Coxiella and Legionella. These include two genes involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis that were previously shown to be horizontally transferred Gophna et al.When the purpose of performing BLAST similarity searches is to retrieve metabolic information for a genome re-annotation  , the output of a BLAST similarity search can be too minimalistic and very confusing. To retrieve enzymatic information  , merlin performs remote BLAST similarity searches to the NCBI databases.The two-point and multipoint linkage analyses Genehunter 26  , Allegro 27 and Merlin 28 were performed assuming a fully penetrant autosomal recessive trait with a disease frequency of 0.001 and no phenocopies. The maximum expected lod score for a first cousin marriage with 4 affected children is approximately 3.01.NHERF1 binds  , via its ERM-binding domain  , to ERM proteins  , a family of actin cytoskeletal adaptor proteins 17 ,18. Notably  , more than 80% of NF2 mutations are located in this ERM domain 23  , and the mutant merlin proteins display significantly lower binding affinity to NHERF1  , suggesting that NHERF1 is related to merlin's suppressor activity.The wizard Merlin is supposed to have built the Stonehenge in southern Ihgtand a set of welldefirmd building blocks and relations and the wizard was able to foresee the future at least to a certain extent such that king Roles represent groups of activities which are logically highly related. Resources are either the people who participate in the production of software  , or tecldcal resources  , namely tools liie editors or debuggers supporting the software development activities.The process engine is that part of the Merlin ezwironment which enables to define a software process in an executable language and which builds and refreshes user's working contexts by executing the given process definition. A process engine's major job is thus to evaluate all preconditions and to re fresh all displayed working contexts accordingly.Afterwards  , merlin accessed the Entrez Protein webservice to download and save several data for each homologue acquired in the previous step. If less than 100 homologues were available  , only those were processed.The query engine consists of a query compiler and an operator library. The Merlin system consists of a multithreaded page server and a C ?+ library that provides the client run time system  , including basic components like storage manager and page buffer.The four paralog sets identified two proteins that we previously identified as IIS regulated in worms and flies: pantothenate kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Data for the individual four genes in each of the four models examined are shown in additional Table 2 in Additional data file 3.The species in the family Herpesviridae are: Gallid herpesvirus 1 GaHV_1  , NC_006623 in genus Iltovirus; Gallid herpesvirus 2 GaHV_2  , NC_002229  , Gallid herpesvirus 3 GaHV_3  , NC_002577 and Meleagrid herpesvirus 1 MeHV_1  , NC_002641 in genus Mardivirus; Meleagrid herpesvirus 1 MeHV_1  , NC_002641  , Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 CeHV_1  , NC_004812  , Human herpesvirus 1 HHV_1  , NC_001806  , Human herpesvirus 2 HHV_2  , NC_001798 and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 2 CeHV_2  , NC_006560 in genus Simplexvirus; Bovine herpesvirus 1 BoHV_1  , NC_001847  , Bovine herpesvirus 5 BoHV_5  , NC_005261  , Cercopithecine herpesvirus 9 CHV_7  , NC_002686  , Equid herpesvirus 1 EHV_1  , NC_001491  , Equid herpesvirus 4 EHV_4  , NC_001844  , Suid herpesvirus 1 SuHV_1  , NC_006151 and Human herpesvirus 3 strain Dumas HHV_3  , NC_001348 in genus Varicellovirus; Human herpesvirus 5 strain AD169 HHV5L  , NC_001347  , Human herpesvirus 5 strain Merlin HHV5w  , NC_006273  , Pongine herpesvirus 4 PoHV_4  , NC_003521 and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 8 CeHV_8  , NC_006150 in genus Cytomegalovirus; Murid herpesvirus 1 MuHV_1  , NC_004065 and Murid herpesvirus 2 MuHV_2  , NC_002512 in genus Muromegalovirus; Human herpesvirus 6 HHV_6  , NC_001664  , Human herpesvirus 6B HHV_6B  , NC_000898 and Human herpesvirus 7 HHV_7  , NC_001716 in genus Roseolovirus; Callitrichine herpesvirus 3 CalHV_3  , NC_004367  , Human herpesvirus 4 HHV_4  , NC_009334 and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 15 CeHV_15  , NC_006146 in genus Lymphocryptovirus; Cercopithecine herpesvirus 17 CeHV_17  , NC_003401  , Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 AIHV_1  , NC_002531  , Bovine herpesvirus 4 BoHV_4  , NC_002665  , Equid herpesvirus 2 EHV_2  , NC_001650  , Human herpesvirus 8 HHV_8  , NC_003409  , Murid herpesvirus 4 MuHV_4  , NC_001826 and Saimiriine herpesvirus 2 SaHV_2  , NC_001350 in genus Rhadinovirus; Ictalurid herpesvirus 1 IcHV_1  , NC_001493 in genus Ictalurivirus; and 4 unassigned species Tupaiid herpesvirus 1 TuHV_1  , NC_002794  , Ostreid herpesvirus 1 OsHV_1  , NC_005881  , Psittacid herpesvirus 1 PsHV_1  , NC_005264 and Ateline herpesvirus 3 AtHV_3  , NC_001987.

Association analysis on the imputed genotype probabilities was performed using Merlin 33.merlin51 is a software tool  , in continuous development  , created to assist on the process of reconstructing a genome-scale metabolic model. merlin provides a numeric confidence score for each automatic assignment  , taking into account the frequency and the taxonomy within the annotations of all sequences that are similar to the gene under investigation
51  , according to equation 1:Furthermore  , among endosymbiotic organelles the dramatic mass increase of r-protein is unique for the mitoribosome  , as the chloroplast ribosome  , exemplified here by Spinacea oleracea  , gained altogether only approximately 170 kDa fig. 2009  , and assuming that this value is not significantly different for the remaining proteins  , the estimated MTS mass of the yeast mitoribosome is merely approximately 10% of its total MRP mass.Microtubule polymers were sedimented through 20% sucrose cushion made in PMEG with10 pM taxol by centrifugation at 20 ,000xg for 90 min. The translucent supernatant was then supplemented with 2 mM GTP  , 10 pM taxol  , 1 U/ml hexokinase  , 50 mM glucose  , and 25–50 nm AMP-PNP and incubated on ice for 90 min for microtubule polymerization.A similar observation in a different protein complex  , oligosaccharyl transferase OST  , was recently reported 42. It is also known that only depletion of the Pop8 does not result in deleterious effects on RNase MRP function 46–51.Several studies have previously found that inhibition of glycolysis enhances TRAIL-induced cell death 46-49. Interestingly  , four kinases were identified hexokinase 1 HK1  , hexokinase 2 HK2  , pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cells PKLR  , and phosphofructose kinase liver PKFL  , which regulate irreversible steps of the glycolysis pathway Figure 3.Each K. lactis gene assigned by merlin with enzymatic functions on either the first or the second similarity search was labelled as an enzyme encoding gene candidate EEGC. Hence  , two projects were initiated with merlin  , allowing the software tool to use all data available in the NCBI database nrDB to annotate the Kluyveromyces lactis genome in the first project  , while for the later project only data from the NCBI’s yeastDB were used.One ERM family member is merlin  , the product of neurofibromatosis-2 NF2  , a tumour suppressor gene implicated in predisposition to meningiomas and schwanomas 19 ,20. NHERF1 binds  , via its ERM-binding domain  , to ERM proteins  , a family of actin cytoskeletal adaptor proteins 17 ,18.The annotation pipeline for genes that encode enzymes described on Figure
3 of the Methods section reviewed a total of 1699 EEGC’s and the transporter annotation function within merlin provided 349 genes. Hence  , such genes were annotated with both transport TCS or TC numbers and reaction facilitation EC numbers activities.Some projects for instance  , MIMO-DB 3 or MERLIN 4  relate CH objects with terms of an external authority or vocabulary. There have been many attempts to automatically enrich cultural heritage metadata.The amino-terminus of the ERM family proteins ERM domain interacts with the ERM-binding domain of NHERF1 17 ,18. One ERM family member is merlin  , the product of neurofibromatosis-2 NF2  , a tumour suppressor gene implicated in predisposition to meningiomas and schwanomas 19 ,20.Despite using merlin  , all of the Kluyveromyces lactis functional EEGC’s automatic assignments were reviewed according to the schema depicted in Figure
3  , so that the minimum number of false positives would be included in this annotation. Only when none of the previous information was available the search was extended to curated homologues of other organisms.GW-association analysis in the TwinsUK sample was carried out using a score test and variance components to account for twin status  , implemented in the Merlin software package 50. College Station  , TX  , USA BC58.For example  , digestive enzymes GO:0004252  , serine-type endopeptidase activity  , P < 0.01; GO:0006508  , proteolysis  , P < 0.01 and glucose metabolism enzymes GO: 0004396  , hexokinase activity  , P < 0.01; GO:0006096  , glycolysis  , P < 0.05 appeared to have undergone significant gene family expansions in the ground tit. We identified 203 gene families that were substantially expanded in the ground tit compared with other birds Table 2; Additional file 1  , Figure S7.The query engine is based on the Merlin client/server storage system Ger96 . The hashing variants of matching operators   , e.g.  , join  , set operations  , and duplicate elimination use hybrid hashing Sha86  , Gra93.Customization means to define the specific roles  , the specific ways of coordination and cooperation  , i.e. It is worthwhile to note that the Merlin rulebased descri~ tion mechanism allows ample flexibility to customize an environment towards particular company's or even project's needs.In general  , the solute permeability PS of control oocytes and of oocytes expressing the different GLPs was affected by changes in pH Table 1. In these experiments  , control and aquaporin-expressing oocytes were exposed to isotonic solutions containing 160 mM of the respective solutes and changes in oocyte volume were recorded during 1 min.SNPs were checked for significant segregation distortion  , and for errors using Merlin 55  , with extremely unlikely calls dropped from the analysis. We used the Mouse Universal Genotyping Array  , MUGA 54  , to yield genotypes for 2 ,058 fully informative SNPs average spacing = 1 ,223 kb.
