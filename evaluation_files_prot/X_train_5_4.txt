Our finding that enhanced autophagy triggered by CHOP deficiency promoted muscle wasting in AR113Q mice prompted us to determine the consequences of limiting autophagy on the SBMA phenotype. Limiting activity of the autophagic pathway did not alter levels of either the wild type or polyglutamine AR protein Figure 5B  , consistent with the notion that other protein quality control pathways  , such as the proteasome  , degrade the receptor once localized to the nucleus.The functional consequences of altered autophagy in SBMA mice were unexpected and suggest that limiting activity of this pathway is beneficial for certain aspects of the disease phenotype. Mutant SOD1  , a cytosolic protein  , is a target for autophagic degradation and stimulating this pathway clears aggregates of the mutant protein.The accumulation of misfolded  , mutant proteins is a common basis for adult onset neurodegenerative diseases including those caused by CAG/glutamine tract expansions 1  , 2  , and pathways controlling protein homeostasis are central to the cellular response to these stressors. Our data highlight the central role of the UPR in remodeling the activity of the protein quality control machinery  , and indicate that robust activation of autophagy accentuates the muscle atrophy of SBMA.Our data highlight the central role of the UPR in remodeling the activity of the protein quality control machinery  , and indicate that robust activation of autophagy accentuates the muscle atrophy of SBMA. While CHOP deficiency activates autophagy and enhances muscle wasting in SBMA mice  , limiting autophagy by Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency diminishes muscle atrophy  , maintains motor function in aged animals and markedly extends lifespan.Furthermore  , in SBMA  , the effects of disease on muscle may be accentuated by activation of autophagy. Our data suggest that autophagy activators are unlikely to be effective therapeutics for the subset of protein aggregation disorders where nuclear localization of the mutant protein is required for toxicity.To accomplish this  , we generated AR113Q males deficient in CHOP  , a regulator of cell survival during ER stress that we found to be up-regulated in SBMA muscle. As the UPR plays a central role in protein homeostasis in the ER and influences survival in a cellular model of SBMA 36  , we sought to determine its role in disease pathogenesis in vivo.While CHOP deficiency activates autophagy and enhances muscle wasting in SBMA mice  , limiting autophagy by Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency diminishes muscle atrophy  , maintains motor function in aged animals and markedly extends lifespan. Notably  , in both cases  , enhanced muscle wasting due to CHOP deficiency is mediated by increased autophagy  , a lysosomal protein quality control pathway that has emerged as a central regulator of proteostasis in several protein aggregation neurodegenerative diseases.Here we explored the role of the unfolded protein response UPR  , an integrated signal transduction pathway that transmits information about protein folding within the ER lumen to the nucleus and cytosol to regulate protein synthesis and folding and to influence cell survival 34  , 35. In addition to the chaperone machinery  , other pathways regulating protein quality control have been implicated in SBMA pathogenesis.In addition to the chaperone machinery  , other pathways regulating protein quality control have been implicated in SBMA pathogenesis. Our findings highlight cross-talk between the UPR and autophagy  , and demonstrate that increased autophagy promotes atrophy of SBMA muscle.To determine whether the ER stress response is activated in SBMA we obtained skeletal muscle from patients and male controls. Further  , increased splicing of mRNA encoding X-box binding protein-1 XBP1 was detected Figure 1B  , indicating that activation of the proximal UPR sensor inositol-requiring protein-1 IRE1 had occurred.This research has involved the investigation of gene networks and  , more recently  , the finding of association between variants at 15q13 and human nsCL/P 10  , 15. Previous research has implicated the Gremlin-1 GREM1 locus in human orofacial clefting.The pathway consists of ligands  , receptors  , and SMAD transducers  , and is tightly controlled by various regulatory layers such as ligand traps e.g.  , noggin  , follistatin  , and gremlin  , inhibitory SMADs i.e.  , SMAD6 and SMAD7  , as well as multiple interactive pathways that cross talk with TGFβ signaling proteins in a context-specific manner 7–9. The transforming growth factor β TGFβ superfamily  , the largest family of secreted growth factors in mammals  , is a conserved family of proteins that play key roles in diverse physiological and pathological processes 1–6.We suggest that alternative approaches to stimulate other components of the protein quality control machinery  , such as the Hsp90-based chaperone machinery  , are more likely to yield clinical benefits in SBMA and related protein aggregation disorders. Furthermore  , in SBMA  , the effects of disease on muscle may be accentuated by activation of autophagy.Many adult onset neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of abnormally folded proteins that self-associate into soluble oligomeric species or coalesce into insoluble protein aggregates. Late in the course of disease  , the pathologic features of SBMA include loss of motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord and the occurrence of myopathic and neurogenic changes in skeletal muscle 6 ,7.Moreover  , genetic disruption of the ER stress response by deletion of the gene encoding the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein CHOP  , a mediator of the UPR 34  , accentuates skeletal muscle atrophy in AR113Q mice. We now show that the UPR is activated in skeletal muscle from SBMA patients and AR113Q mice.Previous research has implicated the Gremlin-1 GREM1 locus in human orofacial clefting. In another sequencing study  , no deleterious rare variants were identified in GREM1 15.These disorders are commonly known as polyglutamine polyQ diseases and are characterized by the aggregation of the expanded polyQ protein. To date  , nine disorders including Huntington’s disease HD  , dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy DRPLA  , spinobulbar muscular atrophy SBMA and six forms of Spinocerebellar ataxias SCA1-3  , 6  , 7 and 17 caused by expanded polyglutamine domains have been identified  , for review see 9.Mutant SOD1  , a cytosolic protein  , is a target for autophagic degradation and stimulating this pathway clears aggregates of the mutant protein. While activation of autophagy following UPR disruption exacerbates atrophy of SBMA muscle in mice  , recent studies in SOD1 models of ALS show that autophagy induction following XBP1 deletion ameliorates the disease phenotype 44.Our findings demonstrate the occurrence of ER stress in skeletal muscle from SBMA patients  , AR113Q mice and wild type mice following surgical denervation. Here we investigated the role of the UPR  , a regulator of ER protein quality control 34  , 35  , in the pathogenesis of SBMA  , a neuromuscular disease caused by a glutamine tract expansion in the AR.These encoded the ER chaperone immunoglobulin binding protein BiP  , the transcription factors activating transcription factor-4 ATF4 and its target CHOP  , and the ER folding enzyme protein disulfide isomerase PDI. Gene expression analysis by qPCR demonstrated that SBMA muscle contained significantly higher levels of several mRNAs that are induced in response to ER stress Figure 1A 34  , 35.Of the clinical symptoms experienced by SBMA patients  , muscle wasting is a substantial contributor to morbidity. We suggest that alternative approaches to stimulate other components of the protein quality control machinery  , such as the Hsp90-based chaperone machinery  , are more likely to yield clinical benefits in SBMA and related protein aggregation disorders.As the UPR plays a central role in protein homeostasis in the ER and influences survival in a cellular model of SBMA 36  , we sought to determine its role in disease pathogenesis in vivo. Notably  , CHOP null mice do not display neuromuscular pathology  , thereby enabling us to assess the outcome of genetic disruption of the UPR on the SBMA phenotype.
