Domains in cullin proteins were characterized using InterProScan 25. Dendrograms were drawn using the tree editor of MEGA 4.This missense exchange is extremely rare and accordingly to the Exome Aggregation Consortium ExAC has been observed in 1 of 120 ,990 alleles. Pro221 is an evolutionarily highly conserved amino acid residue of FLVCR1 and its mutation to serine is likely to interfere with FLVCR1 function.Injection of Morpholinos oligonucleotides directed against the translation initiation codon of chordin Mo1 chordin produced a range of phenotypes of various severity. To test if Chordin is required to restrict BMP signaling to the dorsal side  , we attempted to block its function with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides Figure 8.chordin is zygotically expressed starting at the swimming blastula stage. Loading control is 28S mRNA.We corroborate this and find that protease sequences from the same database assume a star-like phylogeny S1 Text  , supporting the notion that any observed residue covariation is largely due to selection pressures and not due to population subdivision and other phylogenetic factors. Indeed  , using sequence data from the HIV Stanford Database  , Wang and Lee show that amino acid covariation in HIV-1 protease sequences is largely due to selection pressures and not due to background linkage disequilibrium 48.We next generated transgenic flies expressing the dominant-negative form of Cul1 Cul1DN lacking its C-terminal putative Roc1-binding domain and neddylation site 38 ,39. The Cullin proteins serve as scaffold proteins of the SCF E3 ligase and interact with Roc1-Rbx1-Hrt1.The neddylated cullin may accelerate assembly of the CRL E3 complex  , which promotes the ubiquitination of its substrate. The CRLs are activated by the neddylation process  , in which Nedd8  , a ubiquitin-like protein  , is attached to a conserved lysine site on cullin proteins.Accordingly  , additional work in a large number of samples will also be required to precisely determine the role of cystatin M as a prognostic marker and to understand the association of epigenetic modification with cystatin M loss. Furthermore  , patient prognosis according to cystatin M loss was not analyzed due to a short period of follow-up.Similarly  , the function of conserved regulators of BMP signaling such as Chordin in patterning the D/V axis was not known. The identity of the relay molecules acting as the dorsal inducers had not been demonstrated and direct evidence that BMP signaling was active on the dorsal side was missing.Conferring structural stability to the autoimmune disease genes also has a biological significance since incidence of autoimmunity sharply increases in the stable protein forms in the cell 57. In protein structure level  , the higher residue burial is observed in two types of disease genes compared to non-disease genes and the propensity of single nucleotide polymorphisms to substitute hydrophilic  , amphipathic amino acid by hydrophobic amino acid in disease groups could be prompted as a reason of lower sequence divergence in autoimmune disease and other immunological disease genes than immunological genes.Together  , these results define a novel Cullin-3–dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates effector caspase activation in Drosophila spermatids. Finally  , the giant IAP-like protein dBruce binds to Klhl10 in S2 cells  , suggesting that dBruce may be a substrate for the Cullin-3–dependent ubiquitin ligase complex.DNA-damage-induced Ser824 phosphorylation site is marked in red. a Schematic of human KAP1; known domains are highlighted in color and labeled with bounding amino acid residue numbers.Intriguingly  , although the function of these genes has been conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates  , their expression pattern along the D/V axis are inverted  , such that dpp is expressed dorsally in invertebrates while BMP2/4 is expressed ventrally in vertebrates  , suggesting that an inversion of the D/V axis has occurred in the course of evolution 6 ,7. Accordingly  , in all the bilaterians where expression of chordin and BMP2/4 has been analyzed  , these genes show complementary expression in opposite territories along the D/V axis leading to the important concept that dorsal and ventral cells communicate by signals emanating from dorsal and ventral signaling centers 5.In our numbering system  , the first amino acid of the processed M10.5 heavy chain is denoted as residue 2 to correspond with the numbering of the processed forms of classical class I MHC molecules. The sequence obtained  , SHWLKT  , corresponds to the processed mature form of M10.5.Both rad53-H88Y and tel1-N2021D alleles restored resistance of sae2Δ cells not only to CPT  , but also to phleomycin phleo and MMS Fig 1A. Subsequent genome sequencing and genetic analysis of 2 more non allelic suppressor mutants allowed to link suppression to either the rad53-H88Y mutant allele  , causing the replacement of Rad53 amino acid residue His88 by Tyr  , or the tel1-N2021D allele  , resulting in the replacement of Tel1 amino acid residue Asn2021 by Asp.This group II-specific interaction directs the LEP carbonyl to the center of the pore and quasiparallel to the membrane. AtTIP2;1 groups together with aquaglyceroporins and the water-permeable human AQP4 group I  , whereas the majority of water-specific AQPs constitutes group II due to an asparagine at position LCP in loop C Fig 3D  , which can form a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of the amino acid residue at position LEP.The affected residue is in the middle of the TOPRIM_TopoIIB_SPO cd00223 motif at the junction between the TOPRIM domain and the dimer interface and is conserved as a Glycine in all SPO11 proteins for which functional data are available 2 as well as in 92% of 51 aligned sequences defining the motif in CDD. Although this represents a change in the splice donor sequence  , this change is not predicted to interfere with splicing and is instead predicted to act as a missense mutation  , changing a highly conserved Glycine to an Aspartic acid at residue 290 of the 425 amino acid protein.BMP signaling on the dorsal side up-regulates expression of glypican 5  , which may facilitate BMP2/4 mobility and BMP2/4 binding to its receptor  , thereby reinforcing BMP2/4 signaling via a positive feedback loop. B The Chordin/BMP2/4 complexes produced on the ventral side of the embryo can nevertheless diffuse towards the dorsal side of the embryo where Tolloid/BMP1 releases free BMP2/4 ligands that  , in the absence of Chordin  , can bind to their receptors and trigger Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and nuclearization.cul3 contains an unrelated lethal mutation in the background and therefore was analyzed in trans to the other alleles or deficiencies in the region. All these mutations were later mapped to the Drosophila cullin-3 gene and were thus designed cul3 Zuker lines Z2–1089  , Z2–4870  , Z2–4061  , Z2–1270  , and Z2–1062  , respectively; Figure 1E–1G.Moreover  , cv-lysozyme 3 and cv-lysozyme 2 are both expressed primarily in the digestive glands Figure 4; 57 whereas cv-lysozyme 3 minor expression sites overlapped with that of cv-lysozyme 1 Table 1; 58. On the other hand  , the theoretical isoelectric point pI  , arginine residue number  , and protease cutting sites in the amino acid sequence of cv-lysozyme 3 were closer to those of cv-lysozyme 2 56-58.The capacity of RANK-b to activate NF-kB could be attributed to the retention of 93 amino acid residue of cytoplasmic tail 523-616aa of the wt RANK  , encompassing important signaling motifs such as -IVVY- activation of unknown signaling pathway 43 and -PVQEET-  , -PVQEQG- activation of NF-kB and p38 44. In addition  , RANK-b was found to be able to activate NF-kB in contrast to RANK-a  , which seems to act as an inactive receptor  , though incapable of inhibiting RANK signaling.Consistent with this  , FGF-induced ectopic activation of Msxb  , Delta2 and Chordin was suppressed by Lefty overexpression Figure 3M-O. This altered genetic program was similar to that obtained in response to FGF inhibition  , suggesting that Nodal acts downstream of Fgf9/16/20 in b-line neural specification Figure 2C.C Spatial expression analysis of the chordin and bmp2/4 transcripts by in situ hybridization. chordin transcripts are not detected in dissociated or lithium treated embryos but are overexpressed in nickel treated embryos.We performed a functional analysis of several key genes involved in D/V patterning in the sea urchin embryo: the BMP ligand BMP2/4  , the BMP receptor alk3/6  , the BMP antagonist chordin  , and the extracellular regulator glypican5. In this study we have addressed these issues.Budding yeast have 20 putative F-box proteins  , most of which are thought to target a specific suite of substrates 22. Each member of the SCF family of E3 ligases contains the cullin Cdc53  , Skp1  , and the Ring finger subunit Rbx1  , in addition to any one of several substrate adaptors called F-box proteins 21.Early studies of Drosophila Sog mutants revealed that Dpp is widely diffusible in the presence of Sog but tightly localized in its absence  , suggesting that diffusion of Dpp is spatially restricted 57. The ability of BMP ligands to diffuse over long distances in the absence of carrier proteins such as Sog/Chordin is still a controversial issue.D: a single amino acid residue in region 2.1 purple sector allows CsfB to discriminate between the highly similar forespore sigma factors σF and σG: N45 of B. subtilis σG allows binding by CsfB  , whereas a glutamate at the same position precludes binding. Transcriptional and protein-protein interactions are shown in black and red  , respectively.Skp1 interacts directly with cullin and F-box proteins  , with the latter functioning to selectively recruit substrate targets for ubiquitin ligation 23. C. elegans has a total of 21 SKR proteins that are orthologous to the single yeast and mammalian Skp1 proteins  , which are one of the four core components of the highly conserved SCF ubiquitin-ligase complex.Finally  , we report that Chordin may not be required for diffusibility of BMP2/4 and that BMP2/4 signaling induces a positive feedback mechanism in responsive cells by inducing the expression of glypican 5  , a positive regulator of BMP signaling and mobility. Thus  , although sea urchin embryos have a conserved BMP-Chordin axis  , it is manifest by the activity of these molecules but not their site of production.To investigate the contribution of the amino acid residues in the extended selectivity filter to substrate specificity  , we analyzed the permeability of the water-specific human AQP1 HsAQP1 and AtTIP2;1 using in vivo and in vitro assays. This may indicate that a small and flexible residue at position LEP of AtTIP2;1 is required to allow its carbonyl to interact with the substrate in the presence of a histidine at position H5P.Because both protein-folding stress and DNA damage have been shown to regulate eIF2α phosphorylation  , we tested whether these stresses also regulated CReP levels. Cullin-mediated turnover of CReP in response to DNA damage was not restricted to HEK293 cells  , since it occurs in both primary human fibroblasts Fig 5D and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs S12 Fig.Our current study points to a previously unknown link between the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation system and caspase activation during late spermatogenesis. Cullin-3–based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes were previously implicated in various biological processes  , including cell-cycle control  , Hedgehog signaling  , and Wnt signaling 78 ,82–85.C Alignment of amino acid sequences from Bul2 homologs identifies a leucine substitution of a conserved phenylalanine residue at position 883 conferred by the BY allele of BUL2 T2647C. B QTL mapping reveals that segregant sensitivity to ADCB is strongly linked to the same locus on chromosome 13 that controls chronological lifespan.Figure 4 shows the docking results of the interaction between the EAR16 and the GluN2B subunit. The majority of the interactions involve the amino terminal of EAR16  , similar to what has been described for conantokin-G 18  , indicating that the substitution of the residue γ-carboxiglutamic acid Gla by Asp appears to emulate the Con-G interaction with the GluN2B.Comparison with RpsL sequences in the public sequence databases showed that in S. aureus the frequent amino acid residue at position 56 was lysine. Alignment of the M. tuberculosis and S. aureus sequences revealed that RpsL in the Jevons isolates contained an arginine in the equivalent position  , residue 56.Based on the conservation of the molecular pathway used both to develop a secondary axis and to form a nervous system in Drosophila and vertebrates  , it was proposed that this molecular pathway was already used for specification of the D/V axis and nervous system in their common bilaterian ancestor but that an inversion of the D/V axis had occurred during evolution 65–67. In the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevkii  , an “invertebrate like” BMP-chordin axis is also present  , with chordin being expressed on the ventral side and BMP on the dorsal side 3.At this late gastrula stage  , the effects of the chordin morpholino on tbx2/3 expression are much less apparent probably due to compensatory mechanisms see Figure 8Cvii. Also  , we performed both anti-phospho Smad1/5/8 staining and in situ hybridization at blastula stages while Bradham analyzed late gastrula embryos by in situ hybridization.For example  , when a residue was involved in inter-protein coevolution we examined whether functionally important sites nearby any of the coevolving amino acid regions less than 8 Å distance from the functionally important region was previously reported. We therefore used this rationale to test whether identifying coevolving pairs of sites could allow us to identify known functionally important domains due to their three-dimensional proximity.The tag is added to a conserved lysine amino acid residue  , called K164—a ubiquitination target in eukaryotes from yeast to humans. Studies in yeast show that Rad6 and Rad18 tag proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA with a small molecule called ubiquitin.Previous work identified an intronic lateral stripe enhancer in the D. melanogaster locus LSE in Figure S2E 46. We have found that the D/V patterning gene sog  , which encodes a chordin-like inhibitor of the BMP/dpp signaling pathway  , is an NEE-bearing locus in the D. melanogaster lineage but not in the D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis lineages Figures S2 and S3.Previous work has provided multiple examples in which yeast were conferred an oligomycin-resistant OR phenotype by the substitution of a single amino acid in the c-subunit 16–18. In doing so the inhibitor blocks access to the critical acidic residue Glu59 in yeast that serves as the actual proton carrier in the reaction.When compared with p75DD  , the longer loop reorients α1 in respect to α2 and α3 and brings residue E153 of the loop in close neighborhood to other negative charged residues Figure 6B. Only the length of the loop between α1 and α2 is longer in p45DD because of an insertion of four amino acid residues in this segment.The way we encode the context is through recording the relative positions of the n-grams to the query residue  , following the regular expression as " x-|+n "   , where x represents the n-gram of amino acids  , -|+ indicates whether the n-gram is before or after the query residue in the protein sequence  , and n is the relative position. Similarly  , the physico-chemical properties of each amino acid will vary in different protein sequences and different positions in the same sequence.To determine the molecular nature of the mds mutations  , we analyzed first the cullin-3 genomic organization. Because the Drosophila cullin-3 gene was previously termed gft 71  , we will henceforth refer to the lethal cullin-3 alleles as cul3.The functionality of the signals is only marginally impaired by amino-acid exchanges  , as long as the hydrophobic core is not affected 22 ,31. Their determining feature is the hydrophobicity of a ten to fifteen residue core sequence  , which surprisingly does not show any sequence conservation 30.Our results therefore establish that in the sea urchin embryo  , like in all the other organisms where the function of this gene has been studied  , chordin plays a key role in D/V patterning through the spatial regulation of BMP2/4 signaling. Furthermore  , overexpression of chordin eliminated pSmad1/5/8 signaling and suppressed expression of dorsal markers genes.In the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevkii  , an “invertebrate like” BMP-chordin axis is also present  , with chordin being expressed on the ventral side and BMP on the dorsal side 3. A recent study showed that in Cephalochordates  , the most basal chordates according to recent phylogenetic analyses  , the expression domain of chordin and BMP2/4 retained the same orientation as in protostomes i.e.  , BMP2/4 being dorsal and chordin ventral 4  , suggesting that any inversion occurred after the emergence of chordates or  , alternatively  , that a second inversion would have occurred independently in this lineage.Therefore  , Cullin-3 may also play a role to regulate caspase activity in other non-apoptotic processes 13 ,81. This phenotype is reminiscent of decreased activity of the apoptotic proteins Ark  , Dronc  , Dcp-1  , or cytochrome C-d 93–97.Cutoff values for positive or negative expression were determined considering widely accepted criteria among previously reported studies and expression patterns in our normal tissues data not shown. If the IS was less than two  , the tumor was considered to exhibit loss of HER4 or cystatin M expression.Although CSN-3 is dispensable for cullin deneddylation  , it plays an important role in maintaining the stability of FBPs such as FWD-1 in SCF complexes  , as well as the stability of Cullin4-based ubiquitin ligases and the CSN-2 subunit. Our results suggest that  , of the seven CSN subunits in N. crassa  , six act as a functional core in cullin deneddylation.Transfected S2 cells or prepupae brains were homogenized with lysis buffer 25 mM Tris pH8/27.5 mM NaCl/20 mM KCl/25 mM sucrose/10 mM EDTA/10 mM EGTA/1 mM DTT/10% v/v glycerol/0.5% Nonidet P40 with protease inhibitors Complete  , Boehringer; PMSF 10 µg/ml  , Sodium orthovanadate 10 µg/ml in presence or absence of ecdysone 20E. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by Western blotting with anti-Myc  , anti-Flag  , anti-Cullin-1  , anti-SkpA  , and anti-Akt.It is thus surprising that large-scale studies of the CRL complexes from a comparative point of view have not been hitherto performed. In addition of the intrinsic importance of cullins as critical players in ubiquitination control  , they have recently received additional attention due to implication of mutations in cullin-encoding genes in several human diseases 10-13.As SAP functions in an SKP1/Cullin/F-box SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to mediate proteasome-dependent degradation of substrate proteins38  , we further investigated whether SAP could influence the stability of KIX8 and KIX9. The amounts of Myc-KIX8 and Myc-KIX9 proteins were accumulated during MG132 treatment Fig 2A and 2B  , suggesting that the stability of KIX8 and KIX9 proteins is influenced by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.In support of this possibility  , we found that autoubiquitination of DCAF11 was enhanced in all seven csn mutants. The difference in stability compared to SCF and SCF-like E3s is most likely due to architectural differences between Cul4-DDB1 E3s and SCF E3s; recent studies show that DDB1 displays a flexible linkage between the major protein binding domain BPA-BPC and the cullin binding domain BPB 10  , while SCF and SCF-like E3s exhibit more rigid architectures 47.Conversely  , a glutamate at the homologous position of σF E39 impedes binding by CsfB whereas an asparagine at the same position is sufficient for binding. D: a single amino acid residue in region 2.1 purple sector allows CsfB to discriminate between the highly similar forespore sigma factors σF and σG: N45 of B. subtilis σG allows binding by CsfB  , whereas a glutamate at the same position precludes binding.These results expand the range of IAP family elements modified by Nxf1 variant alleles and identify a single residue in Nxf1 protein whose effect on stability  , kinetics  , or interactions explain the modifier mechanism. We also demonstrate by genome editing that a single nucleotide substitution  , encoding a glutamate to glycine amino acid replacement in the carboxyterminal UBA-like domain  , is sufficient to explain the semi-dominant modifier phenotype of Nxf1
.Single amino acid substitutions to cysteine were made in αIIb  , αIIb*  , αIIb"  , and β3 in the positions indicated in the text. To mimic inside-out signaling  , αIIb cytoplasmic domain mutant receptors were made by introducing a stop codon at residue Gly991 to obtain αIIb1–990 denoted α*  , or by mutating G991/FFKR to GAAKR denoted α".Another option that has been applied for the generation of diversity covering variants of PfAMA1 51 is the identification of allelic variations that do not contain the motive at a respective site  , allowing to use a native P.falciparum sequence instead of an artificial one resulting from the introduced mutation of the N or the T/S residue. In most cases when potentially N-glycosylated P.falciparum antigens are produced in eukaryotic expression hosts N-glycosylation is being prevented by mutation of the NxT/S motifs in the amino acid sequence of the proteins 50.Mutant alleles of klhl10 were isolated that block effector caspase activation and cause male sterility. We also identified a BTB-domain protein  , Klhl10  , that selectively binds to the testis-specific form of Cullin-3  , but not to somatic Cullin-3.To the best of our knowledge  , cystatin M has not previously been suggested as a downstream target of ER in breast cancer. Further work will be necessary to understand possible mechanisms underlying the cystatin M loss by ER in breast cancer.Dig-labeled probes were synthesized from the following cDNAs for C. intestinalis: Msxb cign067l18  , Delta2 cieg005o22  , Chordin cign055j01  , Nodal cicl090l02  , Dmrt1 ciad017d15  , Klf1/2/4 citb012d14  , KH.C7.391 cilv038e26 69  , Otx
27 and Ap2-like2 cien223529 Rothbächer et al.  , in preparation. Whole mount in situ hybridization and X-gal staining were performed as previously described 11.Notably  , in addition to our data indicating positive amino acid residue selections within the Chk1 motif  , clear amino acid under-representations were also evident at certain positions Figure 2f. Additional  , albeit weaker  , over-representations included those for Ser and negatively charged Glu/Asp residues between positions +2 and +5.PCR fragments for alk3/6 and chordin were subsequently used as probes to screen a pluteus stage cDNA library  , and the largest inserts were entirely sequenced on both strands. The Primers used to amplify chordin were: Chordin F1  , 5′-TGYACNTTYGGNGCNGAYTTYTA-3′  , which is derived from the peptide sequence CTFGADFY; Chordin R1  , 5′-GGRCANGTYTTRCARCARAANCC-3′  , which is derived from the peptide sequence GFCCKTCP.One of the most recognized functions of the CSN is the deneddylation of the cullin-RING-ubiquitin ligase CRL and this function is reliant on the Jab1 MPN domain metalloenzyme JAMM motif that serves as the catalytic center 5 ,6. Jab1 is the fifth subunit of the CSN and is also referred to as CSN5.Some protein kinases target a well-defined consensus amino acid sequence  , allowing the prediction of potential substrates. Under-representation of Met  , together with other bulky  , generally hydrophobic residues  , was also observed carboxy-terminal to the phosphorylated residue  , particularly at positions +2 to +4.This mutation did not alter the encoded amino acid and it stresses the importance of the exonic terminal nucleotide sequences for splicing at particular junctions. Recently  , a mutation of the A residue of a splice donor site in IBA57 with the same AGgt junction sequence as exon 1 of B4GALT7 was shown to impede proper splicing  , causing a severe leukoencephalopathy 11.No association was found between cystatin M loss and the number of lymph nodes  , family history of breast cancer in DCISs and IBCs. The mean tumor size was 2.9 cm and 2.6 cm for IBC patients with and without cystatin M loss  , respectively.In addition  , because we previously observed that alteration of the glutamic acid residue at position 80 to glutamine E80Q increases the overall activity of the endonuclease without affecting its cleavage site preference  , we also incorporated this change in PB1 to produce a higher activity endonuclease  , referred to later in the text as PB1+. We introduced eight amino acid changes into the endonuclease monomer in order to alter the sequence recognition of the resulting PB1 endonuclease Figure 1B.The ability of this mAb to distinguish between two small structural epitopes in same residue  , posit for its wide applications in both research and clinical settings. One single mAb designated as  , P18C5 mAb  , showed a unique specificity and selectivity for the structural α-amidated isoform of this neutral amino acid in natural metorphamide/adrenorphin and synthetic –Val-CONH2 peptide antigens  , as revealed from our immunoassays  , besides of demonstrating a great capability to detect putative—yet unidentified—valine amide peptide immunoreactive material in specific areas of the rat brain.No obvious relationships of these highly divergent genes with the plant or stramenopile cullin genes could be traced. The genes of excavata species  , on the other hand  , appear as four - five very distinct groups Figure 4.Pl-alk3/6: Degenerated primers were derived from an alignment of the kinase domain from Activin Like Kinase ALK Type I receptors. PCR fragments for alk3/6 and chordin were subsequently used as probes to screen a pluteus stage cDNA library  , and the largest inserts were entirely sequenced on both strands.The acidic residue is located in the middle of helix 2 where it would project into the hydrophobic phase of the bilayer around the perimeter of the c-ring. The most notable feature of this domain is a universally conserved acidic amino acid Glu or Asp in c-subunit that participates directly in proton transfer.A statistically significant association was not found between cystatin M loss and pathologic stage in IBCs P = 0.86. Furthermore  , the histologic grade was not associated with cystatin M loss in DCISs P = 0.90 or IBCs P = 0.32.The Hydra protein has one amino acid deleted in this region  , whereas the Amphimedon CBFβ domain shows a 2-residue insert the same region. This loop was not modeled.Remarkably  , it gives the erstwhile ligand-gated channel the ability to respond to voltage cues as well  , even though it lacks a VSD. Referred to as Kir6.2L157E  , the mutant varies from the wild type by the substitution of a single amino acid at residue 157 on one of the polypeptide components.However  , there is some indication that Cullin-3 can regulate caspases in tissues that do not contain a TeNC domain see below. It is possible that the TeNC domain of Cul3Testis evolved to facilitate coordinated regulation of caspase activation along the entire length of these giant spermatids.Therefore  , on the ventral side of the embryo  , no free BMP2/4 ligand can bind to BMP receptors since an excess of Chordin is able to constantly reform Chordin/BMP2/4 complexes. BMP2/4 ligands expressed on the ventral side of the embryo are immediately complexed with Chordin and cannot bind to their receptors.chordin transcripts are not detected in dissociated or lithium treated embryos but are overexpressed in nickel treated embryos. Its expression increases at the mesenchyme blastula stage  , then decreases progressively during gastrulation up to the pluteus stage.B i  , ii Control embryos showing asymmetrical nuclear pSmad1/5/8 staining in the dorsal half of the embryo. To prevent chordin expression the embryos were treated continuously with the Nodal receptor inhibitor SB431542 starting soon after fertilization and up to the mesenchyme blastula stage when they were fixed and immunostained with the anti-pSmad1/5/8 antibody.Average quantities of methylated CpGs in tumor tissues were significantly associated with cystatin M loss P = 0.008; Wilcoxon rank sum test or ER loss P = 0.0002; Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The methylation level at each CpG in tumor tissues was adjusted by subtracting the quantity of methylated CpGs in matched normal tissue from that of methylated CpGs in tumor tissue.Thus  , although sea urchin embryos have a conserved BMP-Chordin axis  , it is manifest by the activity of these molecules but not their site of production. In contrast with the situation in other bilaterian models  , however  , the territories expressing chordin and BMP2/4 are not complementary but are congruent.The results obtained in this study confirm several well-established ideas in the field  , but also open some novel perspectives. As a step to characterize the evolution of CRL complexes  , I describe here the first comprehensive analysis of the evolution of cullin proteins.Several mechanisms control CRL activity: It can be activated by covalent attachment of the Ub-like protein NEDD8/RUB a process called neddylation or rubylation 26 ,27 or inhibited by the COP9 signalosome-directed deneddylation 28. Cullin RING ligases CRLs are the largest class of E3 ligases.Whole mount in situ hybridization and X-gal staining were performed as previously described 11. While Msxb  , Delta2 and Chordin expression in the b6.5 lineage starts at the 64-cell stage st. 8  , we analyzed early gastrula stages st. 10/11 because expression is much stronger and more readily detectable by in situ hybridization.These genes encode conserved hypothetical proteins with N-termini typical of T3SS-secreted proteins i.e.  , abundance of Ser and polar residues at the N-termini  , only one acidic residue in the first 12 positions  , and an aliphatic amino acid in position 3 or 4Table S15  , Figure 6. The A506  , SS101 and BG33R genomes have 14 to 15 additional genes preceded by putative HrpRspL-dependent promoters; Q8r1-96 also contains one such gene.Amino acid residue changes were introduced by two complementary site directed mutagenesis SDM primers which contain sense mutations of the nucleotides. The polymerase chain reaction PCR was used to construct three plasmid DNA constructs encoding different variants of the H3 A/Perth/16/2009 H3 A/Perth wild-type rHA protein.Modelling of the C-terminal segment suggests that Caldendrin displays an altered surface-exposed amino acid residue distribution  , especially at EF-hand 2 as compared to CaM 18. The second EF-hand is most likely cryptic 16 ,18.Sec  , known as the 21st naturally occurring amino acid  , is co-translationally inserted into proteins by recoding opal UGA codons. Selenium  , an essential trace element for many organisms in the three domains of life  , is present in proteins in the form of selenocysteine Sec residue 1-4.Modeling ATP-analogue binding in the ATP-binding pocket of Chk1 further supported this idea  , as it indicated that  , while the bulky benzyl group of an ATP analogue would not fit inside the wild type Chk1 ATP-binding site  , it probably could be accommodated if Leu84 was mutated to a smaller residue such as glycine Figure 1b. Amino acid alignment of the ATP-binding region of Chk1 with those of protein kinases for which as versions have been already successfully generated suggested that Leu84 should behave as the gatekeeper residue Figure 1a.NJ tree for all cullin sequences. Notice the low bootstrap support for most branches.In this study we have addressed these issues. Similarly  , the function of conserved regulators of BMP signaling such as Chordin in patterning the D/V axis was not known.Importantly  , by comparing two parasite lines in the presence of C2 that differed in only a single amino acid  , the gatekeeper residue of PKG  , we could focus our analysis on on-target effects of the inhibitor. With a second experimental design we assessed the sensitivity of global phosphorylation events in gliding ookinetes to chemical inhibition of PKG by C2.Our genetic and molecular analyses identified a new exon  , 1D  , and suggested that the cullin-3 gene codes for two major isoforms that are somatic and testis specific Figure 2A and 2B. The cullin-3 gene consists of 14 exons  , 11 of which contain coding sequences Figure 2A; a partial genomic map was provided in 71.That chordin and BMP2/4-dpp are expressed in the same territory both in embryos of a basal deuterostome and in embryos of N. Vectensis raises the intriguing possibility that co-expression of BMP ligands and BMP antagonists such as Chordin on the same side of the embryo could have been the ancestral way to develop a secondary axis and the switch to opposite expression territories for the ligand and the antagonist a more recent evolutionary innovation. The asymmetrical expression of dpp and chordin in the Nematostella embryo could therefore reflect the presence of a cryptic D/V axis or a convergent use of BMP signaling for secondary axis specification.It is unlikely that the Cullin-3–based complex regulates caspases at the mRNA level  , because transcripts of effector caspase drice and initiator caspase dronc are present in cul3 mutant testes Figure S5. Our current study points to a previously unknown link between the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation system and caspase activation during late spermatogenesis.All these mutations were later mapped to the Drosophila cullin-3 gene and were thus designed cul3 Zuker lines Z2–1089  , Z2–4870  , Z2–4061  , Z2–1270  , and Z2–1062  , respectively; Figure 1E–1G. The remaining four mds alleles retained various levels of CM1 staining but failed to complement the sterility of mds1  , suggesting that they are hypomorphic alleles.The neddylation status of these cullin proteins reflects the functional activity of the CSN complex in each strain. To test this possibility  , we examined the neddylation status of three N. crassa cullin proteins: Cul1  , Cul3  , and Cul4.Compositional analysis of residue frequencies at single motif positions reveals that major restrictions to specific amino acid types exist only for positions within the CaaX box see sequence logos in Figure 1. This appears to be best explained by the need to have the final peptide part in extended conformation rather than coiled or helical in order to fit into the binding pocket  , as can be seen in the resolved structures of prenyltransferases with their substrate peptides 23.In addition  , cystatin M loss occurred more frequently in IBCs with the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4 than without  , suggesting that cystatin M expression may be influenced by synergistic effect of those proteins. In this study  , cystatin M loss occurred in 9 8% of 117 patients with DCIS and in 99 57% of 175 patients with IBC  , supporting previous reports 3 ,4 ,7 that cystatin M is one of many factors that are involved in the acquisition of an invasive cellular phenotype in breast cancer.Our results show that CSN-3 was not required for maintaining the stability of Cul1  , SKP-1  , Cul3  , or BTB protein in the SCF and SCF-like E3s. The modular architecture of SCF complex is apparently shared by several other cullin-RING E3 complexes  , such as Cul3  , that directly interact with a family of substrate receptors through their common BTB domain  , which has a Skp1-like structural fold 12.Cullin-3–based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes were previously implicated in various biological processes  , including cell-cycle control  , Hedgehog signaling  , and Wnt signaling 78 ,82–85. Ubiquitin pathway proteins have well-established roles in the regulation of the cell cycle  , DNA damage checkpoint  , signal transduction  , and in the regulation of apoptosis 37 ,87–91.The recombinant PschSOD  , display multiple electronic transition maxima referring to phenylalanine transitions at 252  , 258  , 264 and 268 nm and a shoulder at 278–280 nm Figure 1E. Deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNA  , also corroborate this argument  , where a single tyrosine residue is present at 98th position.In the Drosophila Cul3Testis isoform reported here  , the TeNC domain is required for strong binding to Klhl10  , caspase activation  , spermatid individualization  , and fertility. Similar to the SCF and ECS complexes  , the BTB-containing substrate recognition proteins bind via their BTB domains to the N-terminal region of Cullin-3 49.p18ahub mutant embryos L  , uninjected depleted of Chordin  , Noggin1  , and Follistatin-like 2b proteins by MO injection were similarly ventralized N  , +MOcnf to WT embryos M  , +MOcnf. p18ahub embryos I  , O  , uninjected that were injected with 20 pg bmp2b mRNA were rescued to WT or ventralized K  , P  , +bmp2b mRNA similarly to WT embryos J  , +bmp2b mRNA.unpublished data. In situ hybridization performed on these SB431542 treated embryos showed that expression of chordin is strongly reduced compared to controls Lepage et al.Statistical analysis was carried out using R statistical package v2.7.0 36. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test of conditional independence 39 was utilized to ensure there was no three-way interaction with the amino acid residue type.The control of DDB1A nuclear translocation by the ATR kinase and subsequently DDB2 turnover illustrates a novel and specific level of regulation of Cullin-based E3 ligase complex activity. A similar shuttling upon UV exposure was already described for the Arabidopsis CEN2  , another component of the GGR pathway and for the large subunit of the tobacco ribonucleotide reductase 45 ,52.In Drosophila sog mutants  , extracellular Dpp binds to all cells in the dorsal domain leading to broad pSmad staining. At this late gastrula stage  , the effects of the chordin morpholino on tbx2/3 expression are much less apparent probably due to compensatory mechanisms see Figure 8Cvii.Note that at the pluteus stage  , BMP2/4 expression in the ventral ectoderm has faded while strong expression is initiated in the dorsal-most skeletogenic mesenchyme cells xv. chordin expression begins at the swimming blastula stage and is strictly restricted to the ventral ectoderm up to the early pluteus stage where it is only maintained in a subdomain of the ciliary band.Figure shows the exon organization of each alternative spliced isoform with a representative protein structure: i the wt TNFRSF11A receptor activator of NF-kB  , RANK  , numbering in exon boundaries indicates amino acid residue at the splice junction  , ii the 263-aa-residue-long RANK-a TNFRSF11A_Δ9  , encompassing SP  , four extracellular TNFR repeats  , TM  , and 20 aa of intracellular tail from exon 8  , iii the 337-aa-residue-long RANK-b TNFRSF11A_Δ8 ,9 encompassing SP signal peptide  , four extracellular tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFR repeats  , transmembrane domain TM and 94 aa intracellular tail from exon 10 and iv the 299-aa-residue-long RANK-c TNFRSF11A_Δ7 ,8 ,9 encompassing SP  , four extracellular TNFR repeats and 94 aa from exon 10. Inside numbering represents exon length nucleotides.Both perturbations led to a loss of expression of Msxb  , Delta2 and Chordin in b-line neural lineage at gastrula stages Figures 2B  , 3I-K and S1. To determine the function of Nodal during b6.5 fate acquisition  , we blocked the function of its receptor with the pharmacological inhibitor SB431542 or overexpressed the Nodal antagonist Lefty in the ectoderm using electroporation.Thus  , unlike in most organisms in which Chordin and BMPs are expressed in mutually exclusive regions  , in the sea urchin embryo  , their expression territories are congruent. We conclude that chordin and BMP2/4 are expressed downstream of Nodal signaling.In chordin morphants  , BMP signaling invades the ventral side of the embryo leading to ectopic expression of dorsal marker genes such as tbx2/3. This is similar to the situation in the sea urchin embryo.The patterning of neuronal cell types within the diffuse nervous system is included in the patterning  , for example  , the giant neurons near the dorsal midline the Bmp pole; a nerve tract rich in motor neuron axons at the ventral midline  , a specialized patch of sensory neurons near the mouth  , and a line of poxN expressing cells  , perhaps specialized neurons  , on the posterior dorsal midline. Nonetheless hemichordates use the Bmp-Chordin axis for a second phase  , the “morphogenetic phase” for patterning the three germ layers.Renal function was estimated using cystatin C  , which is a marker of glomerular filtration rate 4. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry DXA scan measurements were performed during the last decade of the study and muscle mass status varied between −15 % to +10 % between age 70 years and 88 years and was unrelated to physical activity scores recorded at 82 years and 88 years of age  , with 80 % being recorded as being moderately active.Immunohistochemical IHC analyses showed that valine amidated neuropeptides  , such as  , α-MSH 32  , 33  , metorphamide/adrenorphin 34  , secretin 35  , and UCN 36 are widely distributed throughout the mammalian CNS and neuroendocrine system 37  , including the immune system 38. To date  , no IHC studies using specific antibodies raised against small isovariants of a single haptenic molecule  , for instance  , the free α-carboxylic acid or the structural α-amidated isoform of an amino acid residue ≤200 kDa have been studied or reported.While it is unclear whether the mutant protein of 164 residues is actually expressed  , with more than 75% of the normal SUOX protein missing  , it is very unlikely that the mutant protein fulfills any physiological function. The c.363–364insG insertion is predicted to result in a frameshift beginning with amino acid residue 124 in the bovine SUOX protein sequence p.Ala124GlyfsX42.Our results indicate that the testis-specific TeNC domain plays an important role for binding to the substrate recognition protein  , Klhl10. This result is somewhat surprising  , because there have been no previous reports of tissue-specific expression of different Cullin isoforms with distinct biochemical and functional properties.MEK inhibition led to a conversion of neural b6.5 progenitors into epidermis as demonstrated by the loss of expression of all neural markers  , coupled to the ectopic expression of the epidermal marker Ap2-like2 at gastrula stages Figure S1. We extended these results using a pharmacological inhibitor of FGF/MEK signaling U0126  , three early markers of b6.5 progeny Msxb  , Delta2 and Chordin and two tailbud markers of dorsal tail epidermis midline and dorsal nerve cord  , Klf1/2/4 and KH.C7.391 respectively Figures 2 and S1.This mutation would have resulted in a relatively conservative amino acid change from a hydrophobic valine residue to a hydrophobic isoleucine residue and it is therefore possible that the mutation was selectively neutral. Amongst almost all known field isolated MSV genomes there is only one exceptional genome out of 581; data not shown  , a guanine base is conserved at this site.The sequences of the chordin morpholinos used are: The sequence of the morpholino against alk3/6 is 5′-TAGTGTTACATCTGTCGC  , in which the three underlined bases are complementary to the initiation ATG codon of the transcript.The expression of cystatin F  , α2-macroglobulin  , and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP were also markedly increased. Protease inhibitors were among the most highly upregulated genes; for example  , serpin3An was induced approximately 4  , 14 and 20-fold at 3  , 5 and 8 months in the PPT1 knockout brain.It has been suggested that animals with a radial symmetry could have developed a secondary axis that was lost later during evolution 72. Even more intriguing is the fact that  , in Nematostella like in sea urchin  , BMP2/4-dpp and chordin are expressed on the same side of the embryo 68–71.The difference in stability compared to SCF and SCF-like E3s is most likely due to architectural differences between Cul4-DDB1 E3s and SCF E3s; recent studies show that DDB1 displays a flexible linkage between the major protein binding domain BPA-BPC and the cullin binding domain BPB 10  , while SCF and SCF-like E3s exhibit more rigid architectures 47. In contrast  , all seven subunits of the CSN  , including CSN3  , were required to maintain the stability of Cul4-DDB1 E3s in the presence of CHX.Exons and introns are indicated by thick and thin bars  , respectively. A Schematic structures of the Drosophila cullin-3 gene I and of cul3 II and cul3 III mRNAs.For the human  , fly  , Arabidopsis  , and zebrafish datasets we used a Mascot peptide score threshold of 35; for the mouse dataset we used an Ascore threshold of 19; and from the yeast dataset we took only phosphorylation sites with e-values of 1 × e-04 or lower. Each dataset was preprocessed by removing all phosphopeptides with ambiguous sites phosphogroups that could not be attributed to a specific amino acid residue  , by removing peptides that could not be retraced unambiguously to one specific protein  , and by applying a strict threshold on the peptide identification scores.Our structure led us to re-examine the amino acid residue at position LEP in loop E  , which contributes with its carbonyl to the selectivity region. For example  , mammalian AQP4 has a 4-fold higher single channel water permeability compared to AQP1  , although they share identical or similar residues at the four canonical positions of the selectivity filter.An important RING E3 ligase is the SCF Skp1-Cullin-F-box E3 ligase composed of the adaptor Skp1  , the scaffold protein Cullin  , the RING-domain protein Roc1-Rbx1-Hrt1  , as well as the F-box protein for substrate recognition 31. Substrate specificity is conferred by different classes of E3 ligases  , one of which contains RING really interesting new gene domain.We next tested the ability of cul3 to functionally substitute for the loss of cul3. This proves that both the caspase and sterility phenotypes seen in cul3 mutant flies are due to the loss of cullin-3 function.Expression of the a2 LaSCRL allele was detected in anthers 2 d before anthesis Figure 8B  , but its translated sequence differs from that of a1-2 by one amino acid residue  , and there is a premature stop codon after amino acid residue 45 Figure 3. The coding region of the a4 LaSCRL allele deduced from the genomic DNA sequence contains a premature stop codon and the cleavage site of the signal peptide appears to be defective compared to that of the a1-1 and a1-2 LaSCRL alleles Figure 3.Both the somatic and testis forms of cullin-3 were expressed in wild type  , but only cul3 was detected in the germ-cell–less reproductive tracts of adult males derived from oskar mothers Figure 3C. To determine whether cul3 is germ-cell specific  , we also analyzed RNA from a mutant lacking germ cells.Therefore  , in this particular case  , the loss of functional sites is due to a radical functional change. In this case  , positive and unknown isoforms have a radically different amino acid sequence after residue 114  , due to the usage of different exons after the initial shared portion for this reason these two isoforms are associated with different SwissProt IDs  , FPGT_HUMAN and TNI3K_HUMAN  , respectively and have a different biological function the former is a fucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase  , the latter a serine/threonine-protein kinase.We employed anti-chd MO at 0.82 ng/µl  , anti-nog MO at 4.22 ng/µl  , and anti-fstl2b MO at 8.45 ng/µl and typically injected 1 nl. The sequences of the chordin  , noggin1  , and follistatin-like2b translation-blocking MOs are reported elsewhere 54.v is a double in situ hybridization with chordin and GATA1/2/3  , which is expressed in the non-skeletogenic precursors on the ventral side of the vegetal plate  , while iv is a double in situ hybridization with chordin and bmp2/4 probes showing that the two genes are expressed in a highly similar pattern. Embryonic stages are: 128 cell-stage i  , swimming blastula ii–iv  , xi  , xii  , mesenchyme blastula v  , vi  , gastrula vii  , viii  , xiii  , late gastrula ix  , xiv  , early pluteus x  , xv.The mutation R116W changed the polar amino acid residue to hydrophobic residues while the mutations A43V and D147N tend to increase the hydrophobicity of EstS 34. Both position 116 and 147 are on the protein surface.Thus  , the differences in the growth and developmental phenotypes between csn-3 and the other csn mutants are due to the unequal contributions of different subunits to the CSN deneddylation function. Recent genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the CSN complex is required for removal of Nedd8 from cullin proteins 4  , 13  , 17  , 18.Here we provide evidence that a Cullin-3–based multiprotein complex plays a critical role in caspase activation in Drosophila. Given the conserved nature of these proteins  , our findings may have important implications for caspase regulation in other systems.For example  , in people with cardiovascular disease  , circulating cystatin C concentration  , a parameter that estimates renal function  , was related to 10-year mortality but was insufficient to predict cardiovascular deaths in healthy older subjects 4. So far  , use of individual molecular biomarkers in healthy populations has offered modest performance 1  , 2 compared with traditional  , more integrated disease markers e.g.  , blood pressure or chronological age 3.When cells are grown with galactose  , an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase containing the F-box protein Mdm30  , SCFMdm30  , ubiquitinates Gal4 20. F-box proteins confer substrate specificity to SCF Skip1-Cullin-F-box protein E3 ubiquitin ligases 19.We analyzed Bmp9 and Bmp10 in the micromass system and observed an even stronger chondrogenic effect than for wtGdf5  , indicating that they are potent inducers of chondrogenic differentiation. BMP9 and BMP10 share the same amino acid residue at this position as one of the SYNS1- associated mutants.C Amino acid sequence of RT1-DOb haplotype RT1av1 with the 26-residue deletion in the β2 domain highlighted in red. The shorter transcript Transcript Variant 2; GenBank accession number KC222928–KC222931 displayed a 77 bp deletion in exon 3 red shaded area.In addition  , structural analyses failed to detect significant features that might be used to establish relationships among proteins. The sequences of cullin proteins are very diverse  , so general trees containing all the sequences found in the TblastN searches failed to unravel the relationships among the sequences of distant species as an example  , see the NJ tree for the 490 sequences in Additional File 2.The model that emerges from these experiments suggests that neural induction begins at the blastula stage  , with Chordin and Noggin signaling within the BCNE center and may later be consolidated or modulated by signals emanating from the organizer. now demonstrate that this intrinsic neuronal potential depends on Chordin and Noggin expression in BCNE cells.An amino acid sequence comparison of C. albicans Ssn3 to sequences from S. cerevisiae  , Cryptococcus neoformans  , Mus musculus and Homo sapiens demonstrated this arginine residue to be conserved from fungi to mammals. 6B  , the heterozygous Arg352Gln mutation of Ssn3 in the Evo strain is located within the activation segment of the protein kinase catalytic domain.The arrows indicate the translation start site and the black circle represents a stop codon. Figure shows the exon organization of each alternative spliced isoform with a representative protein structure: i the wt TNFRSF11A receptor activator of NF-kB  , RANK  , numbering in exon boundaries indicates amino acid residue at the splice junction  , ii the 263-aa-residue-long RANK-a TNFRSF11A_Δ9  , encompassing SP  , four extracellular TNFR repeats  , TM  , and 20 aa of intracellular tail from exon 8  , iii the 337-aa-residue-long RANK-b TNFRSF11A_Δ8 ,9 encompassing SP signal peptide  , four extracellular tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFR repeats  , transmembrane domain TM and 94 aa intracellular tail from exon 10 and iv the 299-aa-residue-long RANK-c TNFRSF11A_Δ7 ,8 ,9 encompassing SP  , four extracellular TNFR repeats and 94 aa from exon 10.MLN4926 is currently being clinically evaluated. MLN4924 is a small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-associated NAE enzyme activity that blocks neddylation-dependent cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases to induce tumor cell apoptosis 6.Since cul3 is not detectable in adult females  , this indicates that cul3 expression is restricted to male germ cells  , and that cul3 expression is mainly  , if not exclusively  , restricted to somatic cells Figure 3B and 3C. Both the somatic and testis forms of cullin-3 were expressed in wild type  , but only cul3 was detected in the germ-cell–less reproductive tracts of adult males derived from oskar mothers Figure 3C.This proves that both the caspase and sterility phenotypes seen in cul3 mutant flies are due to the loss of cullin-3 function. As expected  , transgenes with either one or two copies of the cul3 open reading frame ORF fully rescued CM1-staining  , spermatid individualization  , and male fertility Figure 4E and 4F; note the reappearance of cystic bulges and waste bags.In this case  , positive and unknown isoforms have a radically different amino acid sequence after residue 114  , due to the usage of different exons after the initial shared portion for this reason these two isoforms are associated with different SwissProt IDs  , FPGT_HUMAN and TNI3K_HUMAN  , respectively and have a different biological function the former is a fucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase  , the latter a serine/threonine-protein kinase. In a single case a functional site is found in the unknown dataset isoform Ensembl ID: ENSP00000359932 but not in the associated positive isoform ENSP00000359935.Briefly  , an ancestral sequence of 200 amino acids in length was generated using the amino acid composition corresponding to the equilibrium residue frequencies in naturally occurring proteins 28. The method of simulation used is the same as that previously published 7.Nevertheless  , and despite the extensive work done on the intracellular part of RANK through a panel of truncation constructs 43-45  , the exact intracellular molecules that are able to interact with the novel RANK isoforms for example TRAFs and mediate their functions  , are still to be identified. The capacity of RANK-b to activate NF-kB could be attributed to the retention of 93 amino acid residue of cytoplasmic tail 523-616aa of the wt RANK  , encompassing important signaling motifs such as -IVVY- activation of unknown signaling pathway 43 and -PVQEET-  , -PVQEQG- activation of NF-kB and p38 44.We then evolved the ancestral sequence using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation along a bifurcated and symmetrical phylogenetic tree showing the divergence levels explained above. Briefly  , an ancestral sequence of 200 amino acids in length was generated using the amino acid composition corresponding to the equilibrium residue frequencies in naturally occurring proteins 28.In contrast with the repressive effects of promoter hypermethylation  , hypomethylation events can lead to gene overexpression that can significantly stimulate breast cancer progression and metastasis 37 as well as being an effective molecular indicator of distant metastases 38. In addition  , epigenetic silencing of the lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin 6 CST6 is more frequently observed in metastatic lesions than in primary cancers 35 and the epigenetic silencing of the chemokine CXCL12 rather than its receptor CXCR4 contributes to the metastatic potential of mammary carcinoma cells 36.It would mean that Saccharomyces does not have any cullin-BTB complex  , but this type of complex has been found in all other organisms for which there is functional data. However  , this is unlikely.We then performed similar complementation tests with available mutants in this region and found that lethal cullin-3 mutants 70 ,71 failed to complement the sterility of mds mutant males  , suggesting that the mds alleles may represent a unique class of mutations in the cullin-3 gene see below  , Table S1. Utilizing the “deficiency kit” from FlyBase  , the male-sterility was mapped to genomic segment 35C1-35D1 on the left arm of the second chromosome Figure S2.To avoid potential problems with the Cys155 residue oxidation and its post-translational modifications in mammalian cells  , we replaced the Cys residue present in NTnC indicator with Ser in iYTnC  , an amino acid with similar properties. Based on the location of these mutations in Ca2+-binding domain and the fact that the fluorescent contrast of NTnC was previously not affected by the Mg2+ ions Additional file 3: Figure S2  , we expected that reverting these mutations would eliminate the effect of Mg2+ on the fluorescent contrast of iYTnC in neurons.MLN4924 is a small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-associated NAE enzyme activity that blocks neddylation-dependent cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases to induce tumor cell apoptosis 6. However  , additional targets have emerged that allow more selective pathway interference.Eight of the nine amino acids identified as having experienced positive selection in the coding sequence of CCR2 are located in extracellular domains of the protein; one positively selected amino acid residue is located in the second transmembrane domain  , near the transmembrane/extracellular boundary Figure 1. One of the nine amino acid sites identified under positive selection had strong support with BEB posterior probability >95%.Our data provide additional connections and genomic hardwiring to a previously described network 35. Chordin is probably directly regulated by Nodal while Msxb and Delta2 need additional inputs from Otx.A small residue may allow the carbonyl oxygen in LEP—not hydrogen bonded to an amino acid at position LCP—to adopt the relaxed position and interact with waters in the selectivity filter more efficiently. This is consistent with conservation of a small amino acid residue alanine or glycine at LEP of TIPs.The results obtained are compatible with the presence of three cullin genes which I have named Culα  , Culβ and Culγ in early eukaryotic evolution. A logical step would be to include in the name of the genes an indication to which group α  , β or γ they belong.To test this idea  , we examined the distribution of cullin-3 transcripts in the testis and the soma. One possible explanation for this is that the two isoforms are differentially expressed.The Drosophila genome contains three small RING domain proteins  , Roc1a  , Roc1b  , and Roc2  , all of which are capable of activating ubiquitin conjugation in vitro 73. Cullins contain a C-terminal cullin homology domain CHD that can bind small RING domain proteins  , which in turn recruit a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 to generate the catalytic module 42 ,49 ,72.Such changes could not be explained by Smad-dependent transcriptional responses and were not accompanied by structural alterations in synapse morphology. Finally  , mice lacking Chordin  , a BMP antagonist  , have enhanced paired-pulse facilitation and LTP and show improved learning in a water maze test 90.This is predicted to form a protein with incorrect amino acid sequence after residue 212  , at the end of the transmembrane domain leading to a premature termination codon Figure 3B  , Figure S2. The spontaneous mutation fls
t0sp212 was found to have a splicing defect leading to the inclusion of intronic sequence.Measurements of absolute water permeabilities 23 and relative permeabilities to other substrates 24 reveal large variations among water-specific AQPs. Thus  , the identity of the amino acid residue at position LCP in loop C appears to be relevant for substrate specificity  , not only in ammonia permeable AQPs but also in water-specific isoforms.The variation of the carbonyls of the amino acid residues at position LEP is spatially small and hence has little effect on the pore diameter per se  , but it significantly affects hydrogen bonding to substrates. In contrast  , the AQPs lacking an asparagine at position LCP place the backbone carbonyl of the amino acid residue at position LEP Gly 194 in AtTIP2;1—and preceding residues of loop E—in a more relaxed conformation  , resembling that of a corresponding carbonyl Gly 80 in the quasisymmetry-related loop B Fig 1A.As has been reported previously  , the replacement of the axial ligand by leucine or phenylalanine in B. subtilis CotA led to an increase in the redox potential of the corresponding mutants and had a negative effect on the catalytic constants 37. The amino acid residue at position 500 in B. licheniformis CotA is located in a loop region close to the T1 site Figure 5A and adjacent to methionine 501  , which is the axial ligand of the T1 copper ion Figure 5B.In order for this to occur  , the secreted BMPs must bind the D. melanogaster Chordin homolog Short gastrulation Sog and the Twisted gastrulation family member Crossveinless Cv  , termed here Cv-Tsg2 to avoid confusion with other “Cv” gene names. However  , Dpp and Gbb also signal over a long range by moving into the intervein tissues where the PCV forms 7–9.These results contradict the conclusions of a recent study performed in a different sea urchin species on the role of Chordin in sea urchin development 56. Our results therefore establish that in the sea urchin embryo  , like in all the other organisms where the function of this gene has been studied  , chordin plays a key role in D/V patterning through the spatial regulation of BMP2/4 signaling.To test if Chordin is required to prevent BMP2/4 signaling on the ventral side  , we monitored the distribution of pSmad1/5/8 in wild type embryos and in embryos injected with morpholino oligonucleotides against the chordin transcript Figure 8B. pSmad1/5/8 staining Figure 8Biv and tbx2/3 expression Figure 8Civ was eliminated in these embryos.The presence of three PPII helices in the amino acid region 13–33 and the absence of PPII helices in the PXX12 stretch might be another reason for the enormous compaction observed in PXX33 supramolecular assemblies compared to PXX12 and PXX24 counterparts as PPII helices have been associated with unusual structural compactness 38. These were four residue-length PPII helices in which the proline rings at the positions i and i+3 were oriented in the same direction 1 ,38.Drosophila apoptotic effector caspases  , such as drICE and Dcp-1  , can display DEVD cleaving activity 67–69. These results confirm that cullin-3 is required for the activation of effector caspases in spermatids.We extended these results using a pharmacological inhibitor of FGF/MEK signaling U0126  , three early markers of b6.5 progeny Msxb  , Delta2 and Chordin and two tailbud markers of dorsal tail epidermis midline and dorsal nerve cord  , Klf1/2/4 and KH.C7.391 respectively Figures 2 and S1. Previous reports indicated that induced b6.5 fates are lost after abolition of FGF signaling 11  , 28  , 35.Of particular note  , in MCF-7 and MDA-231 cells where SFRP1 expression is completely abrogated  , we observed complete methylation in CpG islands located in the first exon and in the promoter region of SFRP1 in these cells. Consistent with this  , CST6  , which encodes the cysteine protease inhibitor  , cystatin M  , has been shown to be silenced following DNA methylation of CpG islands located within the promoter region  , but not within exon 1 41.Finally  , it is also interesting to point out that APC2 genes  , not considered here given its low degree of similarity  , may all derive from a fourth gene with a cullin domain that also emerged before the unikont/bikont split 57-60. These possibilities may be experimentally explored in the near future.At later stages  , expression of the dorsal tail nerve cord marker KH.C7.391 was lost  , as was the dorsal expression of the tail midline marker Klf1/2/4 Figure 2B. Both perturbations led to a loss of expression of Msxb  , Delta2 and Chordin in b-line neural lineage at gastrula stages Figures 2B  , 3I-K and S1.Residue 211  , which was identified as being subject to positive selection  , lies at the third position within the SUMOylation consensus site IKQE; denoted in red  , with the neighboring lysine being SUMOylated 41. An amino acid alignment in this region for the 20 primate species used in this study is shown  , with residues found to be under positive selection highlighted in gray.Finally  , mice lacking Chordin  , a BMP antagonist  , have enhanced paired-pulse facilitation and LTP and show improved learning in a water maze test 90. Second  , BMPs have been shown to rapidly potentiate glutamate-mediated currents in human retina neurons  , presumably via a noncanonical pathway 89.However  , insertion/deletion of a single amino acid residue can have a profound impact on protein function. Most three base changes to mRNAs probably minimally affect RNA-level properties such as message stability.Starting at the pluteus stage however  , BMP2/4 expression shifted to the dorsal skeletogenic mesenchymal cells while chordin remained expressed in a subdomain of the ciliary band Figure 7Cx  , xv. Consistent with these observations  , in situ hybridization revealed that during blastula and gastrula stages  , the chordin Figure 7Cii–x and BMP2/4 genes Figure 7Cxi–xiv are transcribed in highly similar patterns within the ventral ectoderm  , the BMP2/4 territory being slightly larger than the chordin expression domain at mesenchyme blastula and gastrula stages.This shows that the Cul3-Roc1b-Klhl10 complex is required for activation of effector caspase  , but not for other individualization events  , such as axonemal tubulin polyglycylation. Secondly  , mutations in any of the three cullin-3 complex genes retain AXO 49 staining  , which has a temporal pattern of expression virtually identical with CM1-staining.Furthermore  , overexpression of chordin eliminated pSmad1/5/8 signaling and suppressed expression of dorsal markers genes. In chordin morphants  , BMP signaling invades the ventral side of the embryo leading to ectopic expression of dorsal marker genes such as tbx2/3.We further examined the neddylation states of two other N. crassa cullin proteins  , Cul3 and Cul4  , in the wild-type strain and csn mutants. This molecular evidence  , together with the genetic data  , strongly suggests that CSN-1  , CSN-2  , CSN-4  , CSN-5  , CSN-6  , and CSN-7 form the functional core of the CSN complex for cleavage of Nedd8 from cullins in N. crassa.However  , it was remarkable that the vast majority of neisserial OMPs contain a positively charged residue Arg or Lys at the penultimate position. No particular characteristics of the amino acid at position 3 from the C-termini were evident.To gain insight into the functional significance of L1396  , we first examined the interspecies conservation of the residue. The ENU-induced A to T nucleotide exchange alters amino acid leucine 1396 to glutamine in the RhoGAP domain of p190A Fig 3A.To test this hypothesis  , we searched for loss-of-function mutations in this gene. If Klhl10 is indeed a physiologically relevant Cullin-3 binding partner in vivo  , mutations in klhl10 should affect the function of this E3 complex and thus block caspase activation.A key residue within this motif is a conserved arginine Arg209  , which coordinates with the phosphate group of cAMP Figure 5c. The canonical sequence motif in the PBC region is the FGE L ,I ,VAL LIMVX PVR209 ANQV motif  , where X is any amino acid.The invariant residues arginine and aspartate are indicated by dots. The amino acid residue numbers according to human CEACAM1 are indicated.To determine whether the species specificity of Omp85 recognition is indeed related to the nature of the amino acid residue at the penultimate position  , a synthetic peptide CterPhoEKF corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acid residues of PhoE but with Lys instead of Gln at the penultimate position was added to planar lipid bilayers containing Omp85 channels. The total signal in the native sample was lower than in the denatured sample lane 6  , presumably because the aggregates do not blot very efficiently.The oligopeptide can be dissolved in an alkaline solution but is insoluble in neutral or acidic solutions  , which may contribute to its hydrophilic anionic peptide sequence. The amino acid sequence of the peptide derived from the hydrophilic C-terminal amino residue of amelogenin and acts as a functional domain to induce mineralization.The amino acid residue numbers according to human CEACAM1 are indicated. B The conserved proteins motifs derived from the IgV-like domain.The conserved serine residue at position 361 were indicated with red pentagram. C Amino acid alignment of the conserved Ser361 of HXK1 proteins in apple and other species.Overexpression of Nodal downregulated ectopic activation in anterior ectoderm of Dmrt1 induced by FGF9/16/20 X. Under these conditions  , Chordin was still expressed throughout the ectoderm but at weaker levels W.Yeast PCNA can undergo modifications at K164 by one ubiquitin tag mono-ubiquitination  , multiple tags poly-ubiquitination  , or by small  , ubiquitin-related modifiers SUMOs in response to DNA damage. The tag is added to a conserved lysine amino acid residue  , called K164—a ubiquitination target in eukaryotes from yeast to humans.Outside Medicago there are only two additional short insertion/deletion events: a two-residue insertion at positions 214–215 common to all Medicago and a single amino acid insertion/deletion at position 373 the only insertion occurring outside the 200–241 range. Within Medicago and using mRNA sequences of Lotus and Sesbania as outgroups we observe two short deletions positions 200 and 221  , numbered with respect to the M. truncatula protein sequence CAD10809 and one short insertion two residues between 240 and 241.Epigenetic silencing of CST6 gene in breast cancer has been reported by several groups. The lack of association between cystatin M loss and hypermethylation of the CST6 gene may be due to the density dependence of methylated CpGs on transcriptional silencing by CST6 methylation or the inconsistence of methylation status between primer binding sites and other CpG sites within PCR product.Genetic and molecular studies carried out in vertebrates and invertebrates have shown that dorsal-ventral D/V patterning in bilaterians is regulated by a remarkably conserved patterning system which relies on production of secreted BMP inhibitors such as Chordin Sog in Drosophila which antagonize the activity of BMP signals Dpp in Drosophila resulting in a gradient of BMP activity along the D/V axis 1–4. Intriguingly  , although the function of these genes has been conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates  , their expression pattern along the D/V axis are inverted  , such that dpp is expressed dorsally in invertebrates while BMP2/4 is expressed ventrally in vertebrates  , suggesting that an inversion of the D/V axis has occurred in the course of evolution 6 ,7.Chordin  , which is normally expressed in the progeny of b6.5 as well as in a8.26 and a8.28 blastomere pairs Figure 3C  , was expressed throughout the posterior ectoderm and in part of the anterior ectoderm in response to ectopic FGF treatment Figures 3C and 3G. The posterior neural markers Nodal  , Msxb and Delta2 were ectopically expressed throughout the posterior ectoderm b4.2 lineage or b-line ectoderm  , and the anterior neural marker Dmrt1 was activated throughout the anterior ectoderm a4.2 lineage or a-line ectoderm Figures 3A-H and S2.The CST6 gene encoding cystatin M contains a large CpG island that spans the proximal promoter and exon 1  , encompassing the transcription start site. Furthermore  , exogenous expression of recombinant cystatin M results in the suppression of cell proliferation  , migration  , and matrix invasion in vitro 8.The residue numbers indicated above the sequences refer to RapJ. The amino acid sequences of Bacillus Rap proteins previously demonstrated to be regulated by Phr peptides were aligned using the MultipleAlignerClustalW method in STRAP 61.A conserved feature between Drosophila and vertebrates is that both Chordin and Sog display a proneural activity  , via inhibition of BMP2/4 or Dpp function in the neurectoderm. Taken together  , our results are consistent with a model for specification of the ectoderm in the sea urchin embryo that relies on the hypothesis that the default state of most of the ectoderm in the absence of Nodal signaling is a proneural  , ciliary band-like fate and that Nodal and BMP2/4 act in cascade to specify  , respectively  , the ventral and the dorsal ectoderm  , restricting the ciliary band to the territory located in between these two specified territories.Thus  , it indicates that although a BMP Chordin axis is present in the sea urchin embryo  , this axis is defined by the activities of these factors and not by their expression territory. The co-expression of BMP2/4 and chordin in the ventral ectoderm of the sea urchin embryo contrasts with the situation present in embryos of all the other bilaterians organisms Figure 12.Our finding that the chordin gene is expressed abundantly in the ventral ectoderm and that its product acts as an inhibitor of BMP2/4 signaling resolves this issue. The distribution of the BMP2/4 receptors cannot explain this spatial restriction since Alk3/6 is expressed ubiquitously.Accordingly  , in all the bilaterians where expression of chordin and BMP2/4 has been analyzed  , these genes show complementary expression in opposite territories along the D/V axis leading to the important concept that dorsal and ventral cells communicate by signals emanating from dorsal and ventral signaling centers 5. Genetic and molecular studies carried out in vertebrates and invertebrates have shown that dorsal-ventral D/V patterning in bilaterians is regulated by a remarkably conserved patterning system which relies on production of secreted BMP inhibitors such as Chordin Sog in Drosophila which antagonize the activity of BMP signals Dpp in Drosophila resulting in a gradient of BMP activity along the D/V axis 1–4.The presence of the neural inducers in blastula ectodermal precursor cells prompted the authors to test these cells' neural potential. Chordin and Noggin are also expressed later in the Spemann–Mangold organizer and are among the key signals that mediate neural induction by the organizer.Furthermore  , Cullin-3 preferentially co-immunoprecipitates with Roc1b  , indicating that both proteins form a complex 74. Loss of Roc1a function causes lethality  , and targeted disruption of roc1b was previously reported to cause male sterility 73 ,74.The formulas are also used to calculate the displacement of a residue in GLIC relative to the structurally aligned amino acid in ELIC using the crystal structures. The minimum displacement δ for a spin probe is calculated using the formula:orwhere AC and AO are the DEER-determined distances between probes in adjacent subunits indicated as “short” in Table 1 at pH 7.6 and 4.6  , respectively  , and NC and NO are the distances between probes in nonadjacent subunits indicated as “long” in Table 1 at pH 7.6 and 4.6  , respectively see Figure S4B.Finally  , the giant IAP-like protein dBruce binds to Klhl10 in S2 cells  , suggesting that dBruce may be a substrate for the Cullin-3–dependent ubiquitin ligase complex. Mutant alleles of klhl10 were isolated that block effector caspase activation and cause male sterility.Importantly  , it has been previously shown that loss of dbruce function causes degeneration of spermatid nuclei and male sterility  , suggesting that dBruce function in spermatids is tightly controlled to prevent unrestrained caspase activity 12 ,24. These results suggest that dBruce is at least one of the substrates for the Cullin-3–based E3-ligase complex.The third “x” position was represented by V/I/L Valine  , Isoleucine  , Leucine in a manner similar to the “Ophiocordycipitaceae” and “Cordycipitaceae/ Clavicipitaceae” clades. In the Nectriaceae clade  , the first two “xx” were occupied by GT Glycine-Threonine or AS Alanine-Serine residues  , in which the first was a non-polar and second was a polar amino acid residue.Chordin transcripts are downregulated in embryos treated with the vegetalizing agent lithium or in cultures of dissociated blastomeres but are overexpressed in embryos treated with the ventralizing agent nickel chloride Figure 7B. Its expression peaks at the mesenchyme blastula stage  , then decreases progressively during gastrulation and pluteus stages Figure 7B.C In situ hybridization showing tbx2/3 transcripts expressed on the dorsal side in control embryos at mesenchyme blastula i and gastrula v. Conversely  , pSmad1/5/8 staining was either not detectable or strongly reduced in most embryos 80%  , n = 10 injected with the chordin mRNA iv.The oligopeptide amphiphile C18H35O-Thr-Lys-Arg-Glu-Glu-Val-Asp fabricated in this study consists of “two parts” hydrophilic C-terminal amino residue of amelogenin -Thr-Lys-Arg-Glu-Glu-Val-Asp and a derivative of stearic acid C18H35COOH Sigma-Aldrich  , St. Louis  , MO  , USA. It was characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography HPLC and mass spectrometry.The roles of the cullin protein in this type of complex are quite well understood. Particularly significant are cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases CRLs  , a diverse group of E3 complexes characterized by containing both a cullin family protein and a RING finger-containing protein.An alternative would be that Cul3 proteins in S. cerevisiae may be forming part of two different types of CRLs  , one in which the adaptor is a BTB protein and a second one in which the adaptors are elongins. It would mean that Saccharomyces does not have any cullin-BTB complex  , but this type of complex has been found in all other organisms for which there is functional data.Thus  , CUL4 binds RBX1 to recruit a specific E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and also binds DDB1  , an adaptor protein  , which itself associates with the predicted substrate receptor DDB2. Recent finding have shown that DDB1 and DDB2  , at least in mammals  , form an E3 ubiquitin ligase together with Cullin 4 CUL4 and RBX1 9.While both isoforms share extensive similarity exons 3–11  , cul3 contains a unique  , 20-amino-acid-long N-terminal polypeptide encoded by exon 2  , and cul3 contains a unique  , 181-amino-acid-long TeNC domain encoded by exon 1D Figure 2A and 2B; part of exon 1D is incorrectly annotated in FlyBase as an independent gene  , CG31829. Finally  , reverse-transcriptase RT-PCR as well as sequence analyses of several independent clones from adult testis and somatic cDNA libraries confirmed the presence of two major cullin-3 mRNA isoforms  , cul3 and cul3 Figure 2A and 2B; see Materials and Methods for details about the cDNA clones.Global RNA 5–9 and DNA methylation profiling 10–12 have been recently utilized to study the biology of chronological age. For example  , in people with cardiovascular disease  , circulating cystatin C concentration  , a parameter that estimates renal function  , was related to 10-year mortality but was insufficient to predict cardiovascular deaths in healthy older subjects 4.To test this possibility and to investigate the role of Chordin in BMP2/4 diffusion  , we injected mRNA encoding either Alk3/6QD  , the activated BMP receptor  , or the secreted BMP2/4 ligand into one blastomere at the two-cell stage. This indicates that in a SB431542 context and therefore even in the absence of the carrier protein Chordin  , BMP2/4 is widely diffusible and can trigger long-range signaling within the ectoderm.Identical and chemically equivalent residues are indicated with black asterisks and dots  , respectively. The blue arrow denotes the amino acid residue mutated in the scs9 mutant.We searched for putative ER target sequences within the promoter of the CST6 by using the motif search program 25. To the best of our knowledge  , cystatin M has not previously been suggested as a downstream target of ER in breast cancer.Data presented in the previous section are compatible with the presence of at least three cullin genes before the unikont/bikont split  , followed by lineage-specific duplications. A related point is to establish when the different types of cullins emerged.inc encodes a protein of the Bric-à-brac  , Tramtrack  , and Broad / Pox virus zinc finger BTB/POZ superfamily 13  , which includes adaptors for the Cullin-3 Cul3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex 14–17. Mutations of the Drosophila insomniac inc gene 11 severely curtail the duration and consolidation of sleep but do not alter its circadian regulation 11 ,12.Embryos injected with Mo2 chordin also showed an expansion of the pSmad staining iii  , but it appeared less dramatic than that observed with Mo1 chordin. While control embryos showed a restricted dorsal nuclearization of pSmad1/5/8 i  , embryos injected with the Mo1 chordin morpholino showed a broad expansion of the nuclear staining to the whole circumference of the ectoderm ii.There were only some studies in which a few sequences were examined from an evolutionary point of view 14-18. For example  , no systematic efforts to determine the evolution of cullin proteins in the eukaryotes as a whole have been attempted.Square dots appear above every tenth residue  , and the total numbers of amino acid in each domain appear on the right of every line in the final block. lines  , asterisks represent residues that are identical in all the species.This SNP is non-synonymous  , causing a P446L substitution in SLC5A3; this amino acid residue equivalent residue 451 in the human protein is conserved in all 11 placental mammals for which high-coverage sequence is now available selection shown in Figure 3. The FIS-associated SNP falls within the single exon of the sodium/myo-inositol co-transporter gene SLC5A3  , also known as SMIT  , which is a cell membrane transporter protein responsible for the co-transport of sodium ions and myo-inositol.The fact that in plants  , stramenopiles and fungi the basic  , ancestral number of cullin genes is three suggests that these genes may  , in origin  , be the same. This agrees with previous results 16-18; additionally  , these authors described small cullin-like proteins which did not align along the whole length of the region that I considered in this study and therefore were discarded.Cul3 adaptors have a modular structure  , in which the BTB domain binds Cul3 and a second distal domain recruits substrates to the Cul3 complex for ubiquitination 14–17. inc encodes a protein of the Bric-à-brac  , Tramtrack  , and Broad / Pox virus zinc finger BTB/POZ superfamily 13  , which includes adaptors for the Cullin-3 Cul3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex 14–17.Three strains of S. paradoxus have a frameshift mutation in Pis1 that replaces the C-terminal residue and adds 59 new residues. Sequences of Pis1 from the S. paradoxus reference strain and the S. cerevisiae outgroup both contain 220 amino acid residues.In contrast to the corresponding wild-type peptide  , this peptide did not activate the Omp85 channels Figure 5E. To determine whether the species specificity of Omp85 recognition is indeed related to the nature of the amino acid residue at the penultimate position  , a synthetic peptide CterPhoEKF corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acid residues of PhoE but with Lys instead of Gln at the penultimate position was added to planar lipid bilayers containing Omp85 channels.Table 6 provides the sequences of the SDM primers for the different variants with the nucleotides designed to introduce mutations in bold lower case type. Amino acid residue changes were introduced by two complementary site directed mutagenesis SDM primers which contain sense mutations of the nucleotides.Thus  , the identity of the amino acid residue at position LCP in loop C appears to be relevant for substrate specificity  , not only in ammonia permeable AQPs but also in water-specific isoforms. The variation of the carbonyls of the amino acid residues at position LEP is spatially small and hence has little effect on the pore diameter per se  , but it significantly affects hydrogen bonding to substrates.Together with some additional amino acid residue differences  , this small structural reorientation changes significantly the charge distribution around helix α3 of p45DD Figure 5B. When compared with p75DD  , the longer loop reorients α1 in respect to α2 and α3 and brings residue E153 of the loop in close neighborhood to other negative charged residues Figure 6B.We also found signatures of selection at other HIV-associated genes in the Biaka. We found that the genomic region surrounding the gene CUL5  , encoding cullin 5  , one of the strongest risk predictors of AIDS progression yet identified by candidate gene analysis 36  , displayed a strong signature of recent selection in the Biaka.Amino acid residue mismatches are indicated in blue  , microsatellite DNA SSR units are underlined. Nucleotide positions are numbered according to GenBank entries of microsatellite DNA loci.To prevent synthesis of Chordin and distinguish the ectopic from the endogenous BMP2/4 signal  , the experiment was performed in the presence of the Alk4/5/7 inhibitor SB431542 added after fertilization. Then at the mesenchyme blastula stage  , embryos were fixed and immunostained with the anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 antibody Figure 9A.Deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNA  , also corroborate this argument  , where a single tyrosine residue is present at 98th position. These characteristics absorptions may be indicative of reduced quantity of tyrosine and tryptophan residues  , as reported for other plant CuZn-SODs 6 ,7 ,26.The amino acid composition of a stable 93-residue variant 13 was previously simplified by two-stage combinatorial mutagenesis and in vivo selection. MjCM is an all-helical  , domain-swapped dimer that catalyzes the Claisen rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate  , an essential transformation in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids 13.DSCR4 is an experimentally known gene  , present in Ensembl  , VEGA and consensus CDS protein set CCDS databases  , and codes one known 117 amino-acid residue long polypeptide  , one putative 127 amino-acid residue long polypeptide and a single 79 nonsense mediated decay transcript. 1997 via EST mapping  , was found to be the only annotated HS protein coding gene.Interestingly  , there are three main groups  , highly supported by bootstrap analyses  , which include sequences from viridiplantae plants  , green algae and stramenopiles. Figure 4 shows the result for the set of cullin sequences obtained from bikont species.When a slide showed heterogeneous staining  , we grouped cells according to staining intensity and calculated the immunoreactive score IS of 0 to 7 for cystatin M expression in each group separately. Heterogeneous staining was found in 4 3% of 117 DCISs and in 6 3% of 175 IBCs.This phenotype is reminiscent of decreased activity of the apoptotic proteins Ark  , Dronc  , Dcp-1  , or cytochrome C-d 93–97. Loss of cullin-3 function causes an increase in the number of Drosophila sensory organ precursors and external sensory organs 71.In this process  , also known as spermatid individualization  , spermatids eliminate the majority of their cytoplasm and organelles in an apoptosis-like process that requires canonical cell death proteins  , including apoptotic caspases 12 ,50. Here  , we describe the identification of cullin-3 mutants from a genetic screen for mutants that abrogate effector caspase activation during terminal differentiation of Drosophila spermatids.In situ hybridization performed on these SB431542 treated embryos showed that expression of chordin is strongly reduced compared to controls Lepage et al. Treatments with low doses 1 μM of the Alk4/5/7 inhibitor SB431542 phenocopy the mild chordin morpholino phenotype v  , x.Intriguingly  , the only five species whose genomes encode ADARs with different amino acids at this position are those with the greatest reduction in downstream G preference 20–25% of edited sites vs. 35% in G-preferring group: urchin encodes glutamine  , C. elegans encodes lysine  , octopus and aplysia encode glycine  , and coral encodes aspartic acid. Multiple sequence alignment of ADAR proteins across Metazoa Additional file 1: Figure S3 reveals that this S486 is conserved in ADAR2 across species and is substituted with Asparagine  , a different polar residue  , in ADAR1.The Drosophila cullin-3 gene contains 14 exons  , nine of which encode the bulk of the protein exons 3–11 and are shared by both the somatic and testis-specific isoforms. Solid bars indicate coding sequences  , whereas open bars indicate UTRs.In S288c  , W249L is sufficient to de-repress AQY2 and ncFRE6
. Replacing each amino acid individually revealed one critical amino acid residue with regards to regulation of AQY2/ncFRE6.This possibility will be explored in the next section. The fact that in plants  , stramenopiles and fungi the basic  , ancestral number of cullin genes is three suggests that these genes may  , in origin  , be the same.For example  , microsatellites and LCRs in non-coding regions are often used as genetic markers to investigate polymorphisms on a short evolutionary timescale while LCRs within protein-coding regions bear the imprint of evolutionary processes over long timescales and can be informative on functional roles of these regions within a protein. While some of these categories apply to both nucleotide and amino acid LCRs  , others are specific to one or the other residue type and are  , therefore  , applicable to specific questions.Northern blot analysis indicated that chordin is a strictly zygotic message that starts to accumulate in the embryo after hatching. Like the vertebrate Chordin and Drosophila Sog proteins  , the sea urchin Chordin protein contains a hydrophobic leader sequence and four cysteine rich regions that are present in the same relative positions Figure 7A and Figure S4.The majority of the interactions involve the amino terminal of EAR16  , similar to what has been described for conantokin-G 18  , indicating that the substitution of the residue γ-carboxiglutamic acid Gla by Asp appears to emulate the Con-G interaction with the GluN2B. The residue Met 739  , that has been reported to contribute to the molecular interaction between Con-G and GluN2B 44  , is predicted to form a hydrophobic interaction alkyl with the Leu 11 of EAR16.The former of these replacements is also found in ApaH  , while the latter is unique to Alphs. In the GDXXDRG motif  , absolutely conserved in other PPPs  , the second Asp which stabilises the protonation of a His that directly participates in catalysis 20 is replaced by a neutral amino acid  , and the Arg residue which coordinates phosphate 24 is replaced  , with one exception  , by Lys Figure 3.To explore this possibility  , an OSM-3S316D::GFP construct was generated that would substitute a phospho-mimetic amino acid for the original serine residue  , S316D. Based on this computational analysis  , we predict that the S316F mutation may be altering a phosphorylation site for Polo-like Kinase 1  , Casein Kinase I  , and G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK/Beta adrenergic receptor kinase BARK group of kinases.To assess the function of the truncated BTG1 protein  , a C-terminal deletion variant of BTG1  , which terminates at the common breakpoint after amino acid residue 100  , was cloned in vector pcDNA3.1 and tested for protein expression. Based on these findings  , we conclude that the read-through transcripts that are expressed upon focal loss of BTG1  , are unlikely to give rise to functionally active protein  , which favors a BTG1 haploinsufficiency scenario.Homeodomains of the TALE three amino acid loop extension class are characterized by the possession of three extra amino acids in the loop between helix 1 and helix 2 of the homeodomain 6. In five of six Nematostella TALE homeodomains  , the first extra residue is a histidine  , just as in bilaterians.Only cytoplasmic reactivity was considered evidence of HER4 as well as cystatin M expression. The membrane or nuclear staining of HER4 was not considered in the final data analysis due to low frequency < 5% of the staining in IBCs.These observations suggest that the effect of ER on cystatin M expression may not be mediated directly through ER-binding to the promoter of the CST6 gene. ER is also known to interact with other transcription factors such as AP-1 and SP-1 26 ,27.Under these conditions  , Chordin was still expressed throughout the ectoderm but at weaker levels W. Combined overexpression of FGF9/16/20 and Nodal led to ectopic activation of Msxb U and Delta2 V in both anterior and posterior ectoderm.Complete brain removal can also be achieved by partially inhibiting Cerberus function  , so long as Chordin is simultaneously inhibited in the dorsal ectoderm. The authors show that abolishing Cerberus function in the prospective endoderm results in headless embryos.Since TLE6 is known to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A PKA 18 and since the mutation replaces a serine residue  , we hypothesized that the missense mutation exerts its pathogenicity by disturbing a potential phosphorylation site on TLE6. The variant we identified in TLE6 is predicted to be pathogenic by both PolyPhen 0.991 and SIFT 0 based on the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor GRCh37  , default parameters  , indicating its strong conservation across species and the deleterious calculated effect of the given amino acid substitution.Further analysis of individual lowest energy conformations revealed three left-handed extended PPII helices PPII-1  , P13–P16; PPII-2  , P19–P22; PPII-3  , P28–P31 Figure 4B  , which were identified using the following criteria: i left-handedness  , ii 3 amino acid residues per turn  , and iii 3.1 Å per residue advance 9.3 Å per turn. The high structural variability between various conformations in the PXX12 region might be one of the reasons for the larger size and irregular boundaries of the PXX12 nanospheres compared to their PXX24 and PXX33 counterparts.For overexpression experiments  , capped mRNA were synthesized from the pCS2 templates constructs 75 linearized with Not1 using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit Ambion. The sequences of the chordin morpholinos used are:Although the interaction of HER4 with PR is not known in breast cancer  , a positive association between HER4 and ER has been reported by many groups. Triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER2 was not associated with cystatin M loss  , but another triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4 was significantly associated with cystatin M loss in IBC  , suggesting a different role of HER4 independently of HER2.High levels of Chordin on the ventral side prevent BMP2/4 from binding to its receptor. Nodal signaling induces BMP2/4 and chordin expression in the ventral ectoderm.A stratified analysis was undertaken in which each amino acid residue was assigned to one of four levels of cross-genus evolutionary conservation according to P. falciparum - P. chabaudi CLUSTALW alignment. Chi-squared testing comparing divergence with polymorphism McDonald-Kreitman test within each conservation stratum showed that strong purifying selection was largely confined to residues identical across the genus Table 2  , with minimal evidence for purifying selection in non-aligned sequence regions.The distinct phenotypes of each csn mutant suggest that they may contribute differently to this particular CSN function. CSN negatively regulates the activities of cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligases by cleaving the Nedd8 modification from cullins 4  , 13.Currently we do not know the phosphorylation status of S366. We show that this serine residue is required for the phosphorylation of several amino acid residues in Ixr1.These results support the idea that Roc1b is a functionally relevant partner of Cullin-3 in vivo. In contrast  , CM1 staining was completely abolished in spermatids of the double mutants  , demonstrating that cul3 genetically interacts with roc1b to promote caspase activation in spermatids Figure 5C.The mean residue ellipticity  , θ  , in units of degrees square centimeters per decimole  , was calculated using an average amino acid molecular weight of 110. For the spectra of a refolded protein  , the protein that was completely unfolded at a 7.0 M GdnHCl concentration was diluted with buffer for refolding  , and the diluted protein solution was incubated at the selected temperature until refolding reached equilibrium.InterProScan analyses showed that all cullins have a variable N-terminal end  , which generally is detected as containing the InterPro domain IPR016159 "Cullin repeat"  , a central  , highly conserved region that contains the InterPro domain IPR016158 "Cullin homology domain" and a C terminus  , also highly conserved  , that includes the Pfam PF10557 domain "Cullin_Nedd8 domain"  , required for cullin neddylation  , an essential step in CRL activity regulation reviewed in refs. In addition  , structural analyses failed to detect significant features that might be used to establish relationships among proteins.In addition to the three main groups present in plants and stramenopiles  , several highly divergent sequences are detected in other species  , most of them belonging to the alveolata and excavata. No obvious relationships of these highly divergent genes with the plant or stramenopile cullin genes could be traced.The conserved amino acid regions associated with the α-amylase family are underlined. The predicted start ATG and stop TAA codons are shown in bold  , giving a predicted open reading frame ORF of 1 ,740 bp encoding for a deduced 579 residue amino acid sequence.Colored letters illustrate residue properties. B Close-up on amino-acid alignment in the vicinity of the haw6805 polymorphism gray arrow.One possible explanation for this is that the two isoforms are differentially expressed. Our genetic analyses suggested the existence of two functionally distinct isoforms of cullin-3  , cul3 and cul3.However  , no significant differences in Diap1 protein levels between wild-type and cul3 and klhl10 mutant testes were detected Figure 10A. If Diap1 was a substrate for Cullin-3–mediated protein degradation  , we would have expected to see an increase of this protein in cul3 mutants.He also cloned Akt3v1 or Akt3v2 into pLXSN vector and made a multiple mutation 8 amino acid residue substitutions spanning 13 codons and several chimeras. CL performed cloning of human α9 and β2 nAChR subunits into pGEMHE vector  , and optimized experimental conditions.We found that the genomic region surrounding the gene CUL5  , encoding cullin 5  , one of the strongest risk predictors of AIDS progression yet identified by candidate gene analysis 36  , displayed a strong signature of recent selection in the Biaka. We examined SNP data for signatures of selection in the genomes of the Biaka around host genes shown to be associated with HIV disease or host genes that appear to interact with HIV in studies using cell lines HDFs.The oligopeptide amphiphile was synthesized using standard  , Fmoc solid-phase  , peptide synthesis SPPS  , Additional file
1: Figure S1  , which proceeded step by step in a C-terminal to N-terminal fashion using automated synthesizers. The amino residue of amelogenin was used as the hydrophilic functional group  , and the stearic acid derivative was used as the hydrophobic tail.By using the rescue experiment as a functional assay  , we provided a conclusive demonstration that Nodal does not work as a morphogen but requires a relay identified as BMP2/4. We performed a functional analysis of several key genes involved in D/V patterning in the sea urchin embryo: the BMP ligand BMP2/4  , the BMP receptor alk3/6  , the BMP antagonist chordin  , and the extracellular regulator glypican5.It is highly unlikely that our model is of LI2  , in which missense mutations have only been found within or near the first nucleotide binding domain of the protein 10. A missense mutation similar to that of our mouse glycine to charged amino acid in a highly conserved TM domain residue has been shown to cause severe HI 31.We identified several components of desmosomes – Dsp  , Dsg2  , desmocollin 2 Dsc2; MGI: 103221  , and plakophilin 2 Pkp2; MGI: 1914701 – whose expression was significantly downregulated in the highly invasive tumor lesions that develop in the RT2 mouse model of PNET. Our results clearly demonstrate that the conditional genetic deletion of a single core desmosomal component  , Dsp  , promotes increased local tumor invasion in RT2 mice  , producing a phenocopy of such inferred transcriptional regulation in the normal circumstances of tumor progression.In contrast to earlier mutational studies 4  , our new structural insight has allowed us to rationally design and implant a TIP2-like substrate profile to a water-specific AQP. A small residue may allow the carbonyl oxygen in LEP—not hydrogen bonded to an amino acid at position LCP—to adopt the relaxed position and interact with waters in the selectivity filter more efficiently.To prevent chordin expression the embryos were treated continuously with the Nodal receptor inhibitor SB431542 starting soon after fertilization and up to the mesenchyme blastula stage when they were fixed and immunostained with the anti-pSmad1/5/8 antibody. At the two-cell stage  , embryos were injected into one blastomere with either mRNA encoding the activated Alk3/6 receptor  , alk3/6QD  , or with the bmp2/4 mRNA together with a green fluorescent dextran FLDX as a lineage tracer.Artificial proteins  , including simplified binding domains 10  , 11 and enzymes 12 further corroborate that significant biological activity can be achieved with low amino acid diversity. For example  , the antifreeze protein from winter flounder  , which adopts a 48-residue helix  , is composed of only seven different residues 9.Thus  , slight length variation occurred either within the first 45 amino acid positions  , or at the C-terminus end i.e.  , the two Quadrula MCOX2e sequences were one amino acid shorter than the others due to the deletion of the terminal residue. The first six nucleotides and those from position 136–558 aligned unambiguously and were used in alignment-based analyses containing Mcox2e  , while those from positions 7–135 were removed prior to all alignment-based analyses.N-terminal sequencing of the M10.5 heavy chain was accomplished by first blotting gel-run protein to a PVDF membrane polyvinylidene fluoride  , Millipore  , Billerica  , Massachusetts  , United States  , followed by sequencing using a 492 cLC Procise protein micro-sequencer Applied Biosystems  , Foster City  , California  , United States. In our numbering system  , the first amino acid of the processed M10.5 heavy chain is denoted as residue 2 to correspond with the numbering of the processed forms of classical class I MHC molecules.B A near-consensus βTRCP degron in CReP  , compared to well-validated degrons. Where indicated  , 1 μM MLN4924 was added 4 hours before cell collection to inhibit cullin activity.Recent studies have shown that the dpp and chordin genes are present in the genomes of cnidarians  , which are positioned phylogenetically as an outgroup to the bilaterians. Functional analysis of the cnidarian chordin and dpp genes and investigation of the role of the BMP chordin signaling network in additional protostomes organisms are required to address these issues.Nonetheless hemichordates use the Bmp-Chordin axis for a second phase  , the “morphogenetic phase” for patterning the three germ layers. If true  , the dorsoventral axis would have been a locus of much more evolution in chordates than was the anteroposterior axis since  , as we showed previously 45  , the gene expression domains of this axis are extensively similar in both groups  , hence in the deuterostome ancestor.On average they can only achieve between 3.15–7.4 amino acid substitutions per residue 6. A recent  , in-depth comparison of random mutagenesis methods showed that the existing methods are limited and highly biased.In the first step  , the three helices in the enzyme were replaced with binary-patterned modules 16  , 17 of randomized sequence  , whereby only hydrophobic side chains were allowed for residues facing the interior of the protein and surface residues were constrained to polar building blocks 18. The amino acid composition of a stable 93-residue variant 13 was previously simplified by two-stage combinatorial mutagenesis and in vivo selection.A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between cystatin M loss and any covariates found to be statistically significant in the univariate analysis  , and to calculate odds ratios ORs. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test or t-test and Fisher's exact test or the Chi-squared test were used for the univariate analysis of the continuous and categorical variables  , respectively.Under normal oxygen conditions  , the VHL protein forms a complex with elongin B  , elongin C  , and cullin 2 which targets hydroxylated hypoxia inducible factor-alpha HIFα for ubiquitin-mediated degradation 7  , 8. The VHL gene plays a role in tissue-specific responses to oxygen concentration and delivery.used RNA concentrations one order of magnitude lower. In our study  , we used doses of synthetic chordin mRNA up to 1 mg/ml while Bradham et al.We have found that the D/V patterning gene sog  , which encodes a chordin-like inhibitor of the BMP/dpp signaling pathway  , is an NEE-bearing locus in the D. melanogaster lineage but not in the D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis lineages Figures S2 and S3. Not all NEE-bearing loci in one species are necessarily NEE-bearing in other species.Chordin is probably directly regulated by Nodal while Msxb and Delta2 need additional inputs from Otx. We have shown that three FGF-dependent genes expressed in the b6.5 progeny from the 64-cell stage show differential regulation by Nodal signaling.The most severely affected embryos were either completely radialized as shown by the presence of multiple ectopic spicules Figure 8Ai  , vi or displayed profound defects in the establishment of D/V polarity such as the absence of ventral arms and dorsal apex but still retained a D/V polarity Figure 8Aii  , vii. Injection of Morpholinos oligonucleotides directed against the translation initiation codon of chordin Mo1 chordin produced a range of phenotypes of various severity.Chi-squared testing was undertaken testing whether the distribution of amino acid variants in terms of conservation level was the same as the distribution of total sequence  , using 13 conservation levels bins of 1  , and hence 12 degrees of freedom. All residues known to be intrinsic to resistance haplotypes  , whether or not each individual residue has been shown to cause drug-resistance independently  , were included.Ap2-like2  , normally expressed in epidermis expression C  , D is ectopically expressed in a- and b-line neural precursors white arrowheads G  , H. Treatment from the 8-cell stage with the MEK inhibitor U0126 led to a loss of Delta2 E and Chordin F expression in the ectoderm at early gastrula stages st. 10.The finding that BMP2/4 is produced on the ventral side but that BMP signaling is active on the dorsal side raised two intriguing questions: what prevents BMP2/4 from signaling in ventral cells and what promotes diffusion of BMP2/4 towards the dorsal side ? Thus  , unlike in most organisms in which Chordin and BMPs are expressed in mutually exclusive regions  , in the sea urchin embryo  , their expression territories are congruent.p-Values for individual amino acid residue contingency tables were computed by Monte Carlo simulations with the number of replicates B = 106. Statistical analysis was carried out using R statistical package v2.7.0 36.We assume that alterations are binary: in each sample  , an alteration either occurs or does not occur. the somatic mutation of gene  , a mutation in a particular amino acid residue such as the V600E mutations in the BRAF gene that are common in colorectal and other cancers 56  , or an epigenetic change such as hypermethylation of a promoter.Because neddylation is known to regulate the activity of CRLs  , we investigated whether axr1 meiotic defects are dependent on a specific CRL. Complete suppression of any of cullin functions null cul1 or cul4 or the double cul3a cul3b mutants is lethal  , but various genetic backgrounds deficient in cullin activities are availableThe ability of BMP ligands to diffuse over long distances in the absence of carrier proteins such as Sog/Chordin is still a controversial issue. found that the range of Dpp action was reduced but still substantial  , consistent with free diffusion 58.Note that the available aa sequence of a1-2 is identical to that of a2 except for one amino acid residue located in the intracellular kinase domain. Green horizontal bars above aligned sequences represent identity between sequences.Chordin and Noggin are also expressed later in the Spemann–Mangold organizer and are among the key signals that mediate neural induction by the organizer. The authors call this group of cells the BCNE blastula Chordin- and Noggin-expressing center  , based on their previous observation that this center expresses the proteins Chordin and Noggin at the blastula stage.The amino acid numbering refers to putative mature sequences  , after manual processing of their peptide sequences. Note that an alanine and an asparagine residues in the LiP models occupy the position of the catalytic glutamate and aspartate involved in Mn2+ oxidation by MnP  , and a serine residue in the MnP models occupies the position of the putative catalytic tryptophan characterizing LiP.Nedd8 modification of cullin positively regulates the activities of CRLs. Consistent with phenotypic analysis results  , our molecular analyses demonstrated that CSN-3 was not required for cullin deneddylation  , while deletion of any of the other six csn genes caused hyperneddylation of all three cullins  , indicating that in N. crassa  , these six CSN subunits were essential for cleavage of Nedd8 from the cullins of CRLs in vivo.Injection of Mo1 chordin morpholino caused absolutely no toxicity even when high doses up to 2 mM were used while the Mo2 chordin started to cause non-specific defects when injected at concentrations above 0.8 mM. Mo1 chordin: 5′-GGTATAAATCACGACACGGTA; Mo2 chordin: CGAAGATAAAAACTTCCAAGGTGTC.Dendrogram of cullin sequences obtained from bikont species. Details can be found in Additional File 5.Then at the mesenchyme blastula stage  , embryos were fixed and immunostained with the anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 antibody Figure 9A. To test this possibility and to investigate the role of Chordin in BMP2/4 diffusion  , we injected mRNA encoding either Alk3/6QD  , the activated BMP receptor  , or the secreted BMP2/4 ligand into one blastomere at the two-cell stage.The expressed protein was labeled with 15N  , and the NMR spectrum showed that the first 25 residues adopt random coil fold. For NMR structure determination  , we initially expressed a 150-amino-acid-residue-long C-terminal part of A. ventricosus MiSp full-length sequence above.The Cullin proteins serve as scaffold proteins of the SCF E3 ligase and interact with Roc1-Rbx1-Hrt1. In contrast  , all dendrites were pruned completely in the wild-type ddaC neurons n = 15; Figure 1B′ and 1G.PCR reactions were carried out using DyNAzyme EXT DNA polymerase Finnzymes; http://www.finnzymes.fi  , according to the manufacturer instructions. Genomic DNA 2 μg was used to amplify overlapping fragments from the cullin-3 or klhl10 loci in wild-type and homozygote mutant lines.Therefore  , we analyzed the association of triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER2 with cystatin M loss. Triple-negative breast cancers TNBCs of ER  , PR  , and HER2  , are known to be typically associated with poor prognosis due to aggressive behavior of the tumor and lack of targeted therapies.The CD spectra of Tm-RNase HII  , Aa-RNase HII  , and Sto-RNase HI in the absence and presence of GdnHCl were measured on a J-725 automatic spectropolarimeter Japan Spectroscopic. The mean residue ellipticity  , θ  , in units of degrees square centimeters per decimole  , was calculated using an average amino acid molecular weight of 110.We used multiple alignment to check whether an amino acid that is deleterious in flies can co-occur with D. melanogaster amino acids at this interacting sites. We determined all amino acid residues that directly interact with a CPD residue  , requiring that the distance between their closest atoms does not exceed 4 Å in wild type or mutant.The substrate specificity of Cullin-based E3 complexes is generally achieved through a variety of substrate recognition adaptors that may be differentially available in different cell types 41 ,49 ,72. Our results indicate that the testis-specific TeNC domain plays an important role for binding to the substrate recognition protein  , Klhl10.We show that this serine residue is required for the phosphorylation of several amino acid residues in Ixr1. Interestingly  , the mutation in the Ixr1 S366 residue that is important for interaction of HMG boxes with DNA results in the same phenotype as the deletion of IXR1 gene.Nodal does not need to diffuse over a long range to rescue the dorsal structures  , and therefore it must work by inducing a relay. It therefore follows that specification and patterning of the D/V axis of the sea urchin embryo does not result from the interactions between a BMP expressing ventral centre and a Chordin expressing dorsal centre  , as in vertebrates  , but that the activities of these two centres  , which are both induced by Nodal  , are concentrated within the ventral ectoderm.The importance of the extended selectivity filter is demonstrated by mutational studies in vivo and in vitro  , showing gain-of-function of AtTIP2;1 substrate selectivity in the water-specific human AQP1. The structure reveals an extended selectivity filter  , including a fifth amino acid residue at position LCP in loop C that also may play a role in defining substrate profiles of the entire AQP superfamily.The association between cystatin M loss and clinicopathological parameters in 117 DCISs and 175 IBCs is shown in Table 1. If the mean score was less than two  , the tumor was considered to exhibit loss of cystatin M expression.The selected genes derived from Homo sapiens Cul3 and Cul7 proteins  , Drosophila melanogaster CG11261  , Caenorhabditis elegans Cul4  , Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cul8  , Debaryomyces hansenii Accession number CR382135.2  , Cyanidioschyzon merolae Acc. These sequences were selected both to cover all the variation detected in previous analyses of cullin proteins and also to specifically check for all members of potential new families  , most especially in protozoans.Taken together  , the present study suggests that cystatin M loss in IBC may be associated with triple negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4. Accordingly  , additional work in a large number of samples will also be required to precisely determine the role of cystatin M as a prognostic marker and to understand the association of epigenetic modification with cystatin M loss.The amino-acid variety in PHO84 homologs was established with ConSurf 46. CSI-BLAST resulted in 501 sequences  , which were used to calculate the residue variety in percentage for each position in the query sequence Pho84 ORF.We show that the small RING domain protein  , Roc1b  , interacts with Cullin-3 in spermatids to promote effector caspase activation. In our screen  , we isolated several cullin-3 alleles with mutations in a testis-specific N-terminal Cullin-3 TeNC domain.The most perturbed regions are shaded in grey. B  , Top Accessible surface area ASA for individual amino acid residues  , expressed as percentage of the total surface area of each residue.Pro221 is an evolutionarily highly conserved amino acid residue of FLVCR1 and its mutation to serine is likely to interfere with FLVCR1 function. Again  , the second FLVCR1 allele harbors a loss-of-function frameshift mutation  , which has not been described until now.For example  , no systematic efforts to determine the evolution of cullin proteins in the eukaryotes as a whole have been attempted. It is thus surprising that large-scale studies of the CRL complexes from a comparative point of view have not been hitherto performed.We also found that in the sea urchin  , chordin is co-expressed with BMP2/4 but that despite this very unusual expression pattern  , it has a conserved role in antagonizing BMP2/4. By using anti-phospho-Smad immunostaining as a direct read-out of BMP signaling  , we discovered that BMP2/4 produced in ventral cells activates BMP signaling on the dorsal side of the embryo  , and therefore that in the sea urchin embryo  , the dorsal ectoderm is induced by ventrally produced signals.Representative immunohistochemical statinings of ER  , PR  , HER2  , HER4  , and cystatin M in DCIS and IBC lesions. Most cells in the upper row of DCIS and IBC lesions show strong nuclear reactivity for ER and PR  , strong membrane reactivity for HER2  , and strong cytoplasmic staining for HER4 and cystatin M. Magnification × 400.Surprisingly  , in embryos of the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevkii  , which have a diffuse neural system  , the BMP signaling pathway does not repress neural gene expression 3. A conserved feature between Drosophila and vertebrates is that both Chordin and Sog display a proneural activity  , via inhibition of BMP2/4 or Dpp function in the neurectoderm.Mo1 chordin: 5′-GGTATAAATCACGACACGGTA; Mo2 chordin: CGAAGATAAAAACTTCCAAGGTGTC. All the experiments were repeated at least two to three times and only representative phenotypes observed in a majority of embryos are presented here.It is therefore likely that while BCNE cells harbor an intrinsic neural potential  , neural induction in a living organism occurs via cooperation between the germ layers. Complete brain removal can also be achieved by partially inhibiting Cerberus function  , so long as Chordin is simultaneously inhibited in the dorsal ectoderm.The CRL complexes also often contain one or more adaptor proteins  , which at the same time bind the cullin and recruit the substrate receptor 5 ,6. Structural data indicate that cullins act as backbones that facilitate ubiquitination by correctly positioning both the RING finger-containing protein  , that recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2  , and another protein present in the CRL complex  , the substrate receptor  , which confers substrate specificity.In this system  , canonical apoptotic proteins are used to dramatically remodel cell structure by eliminating many organelles and the majority of cytoplasm 12 ,50. In the present study  , we show a physiological requirement of a cullin-3–based E3-ubiqutin ligase complex for caspase activation and sperm differentiation in Drosophila.This result indicates that one function of Chordin is to prevent BMP2/4 from binding to and activating its receptor in the ventral ectoderm. This expansion of tbx2/3 expression was also visible at gastrula stages  , although it appeared less dramatic at this stage  , suggesting the existence of compensatory regulatory mechanisms Figure 8Bvii.Also clearly under-represented were acidic residues at -2 and -4 surrounding the basic residue at -3. More striking  , however  , was the pattern of under-represented amino acid residues  , which included Thr at -1 and basic residues at +2 and +3.A more likely model is that the Cul3-Roc1b-Klhl10 complex promotes degradation of a caspase inhibitor Figure 9. It is unlikely that the Cullin-3–based complex regulates caspases at the mRNA level  , because transcripts of effector caspase drice and initiator caspase dronc are present in cul3 mutant testes Figure S5.SKR-1/2 are highly conserved orthologues of Skp1  , a component of many protein complexes including the Skp-Cullin-F box ubiquitin ligase SCF that regulates cell cycle progression and differentiation 23 ,24. Using genome-wide RNAi screening  , we identified SKR-1/2 as required for the core SKN-1 transcriptional response to diverse pro-oxidant compounds.At position 305  , the plant subgroup has either a basic amino acid or a proline  , while in the other subgroups the class of amino acids is not conserved. Position 304 is occupied by phenylalanine only in the plant sequences while the bacterial subgroups have mostly aliphatic amino acids as a residue in this position.Interestingly  , mutations have been described in other species in the Mc1r arginine residue homologous to the one mutated in Yerbaniz and Japonés individuals  , including rock pocket mice Chaetodipus intermedius and humans. Therefore  , we reasoned that the identical charge-changing amino acid mutation at the homologous position would be extremely likely to cause diminished function of Mc1r protein in the Yerbaniz and Japonés populations of cavefish  , explaining the presence of the brown mutation in these fish.For comparison  , wild-type BTG1 was included in the analyses Figure S1A. To assess the function of the truncated BTG1 protein  , a C-terminal deletion variant of BTG1  , which terminates at the common breakpoint after amino acid residue 100  , was cloned in vector pcDNA3.1 and tested for protein expression.The restricted diffusion of BMP ligands in the absence of carrier proteins such as Sog/Chordin has been proposed to be a key parameter and a condition for robustness in one of the mathematical models proposed to explain formation of the Dpp gradient. Early studies of Drosophila Sog mutants revealed that Dpp is widely diffusible in the presence of Sog but tightly localized in its absence  , suggesting that diffusion of Dpp is spatially restricted 57.While some of these categories apply to both nucleotide and amino acid LCRs  , others are specific to one or the other residue type and are  , therefore  , applicable to specific questions. Because of the heterogeneity of LCRs  , regions within this category are often sub-categorized according to their unique structure and composition producing a large terminology associated with LCRs that includes micro/mini-satellites  , tandem repeats  , interspersed repeats  , simple sequence repeats  , single amino acid repeats  , homopolymers  , and heteropolymers.Indeed  , in the two examples we tested V. cholerae G145E and G333K; see Fig 3 and S1 Fig  , exchanging the NtrC1 residue for the corresponding LuxO residue derepressed LuxO. Despite the high homology between LuxO proteins and NtrC proteins  , key amino acid differences appear to prevent NtrC proteins from adopting the inactive conformation we observe for LuxO.Phylogenetic trees corresponding to animal cullin sequences. Details of the sequences can be found in Additional File 3.Jab1 exists not only as a member of the CSN holocomplex and smaller CSN complexes  , but also as a monomer with a number of different unique protein interactions and functions outside of the CSN. One of the most recognized functions of the CSN is the deneddylation of the cullin-RING-ubiquitin ligase CRL and this function is reliant on the Jab1 MPN domain metalloenzyme JAMM motif that serves as the catalytic center 5 ,6.The N-terminal region of the Cullin proteins interacts with the adaptor subunit Skp1  , and via it with an F-box protein to recruit protein substrates in proximity to the E2 enzyme  , thereby promoting substrate ubiquitination 31. Hence  , SkpA  , like Cul1 and Roc1a  , appears to govern ddaC dendrite pruning.In contrast  , the AQPs lacking an asparagine at position LCP place the backbone carbonyl of the amino acid residue at position LEP Gly 194 in AtTIP2;1—and preceding residues of loop E—in a more relaxed conformation  , resembling that of a corresponding carbonyl Gly 80 in the quasisymmetry-related loop B Fig 1A. In this conformation  , the peptide bonds of this and the two preceding residues are contorted.One single mAb designated as  , P18C5 mAb  , showed a unique specificity and selectivity for the structural α-amidated isoform of this neutral amino acid in natural metorphamide/adrenorphin and synthetic –Val-CONH2 peptide antigens  , as revealed from our immunoassays  , besides of demonstrating a great capability to detect putative—yet unidentified—valine amide peptide immunoreactive material in specific areas of the rat brain. The present work describes an experimental strategy used to generate murine monoclonal antibodies able to differentiate between two isovariants of the valine residue.As indicated in Figure 5  , the three groups may have emerged from the diversification of single ancestral cullin genes  , all of them originated very early in eukaryotic evolution  , before the separation of unikonts and bikonts. The deepest dichotomy shown in Figure 5 separates a group formed by several animal cullin genes Cul1  , Cul2  , Cul5  , Cul-Dros  , Cul7/Parc a single fungal cullin gene Cul1  , also known as Cdc53 and two recently duplicated plant cullin genes Cul1 and Cul2 from two other groups which respectively include the cullin genes so far named Cul3 and Cul4 in animals  , plants and fungi.To test if Chordin is required to restrict BMP signaling to the dorsal side  , we attempted to block its function with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides Figure 8. Interestingly this phenotype is also identical to the phenotype obtained following partial inhibition of Alk4/5/7 function using low doses of the SB431542 inhibitor  , which strongly reduce chordin expression Figure 8Av  , x and unpublished data.SNAI2  , Zeb2 and other family members have multiple gene targets and can recruit specific chromatin-remodelling complexes that repress E-cadherin CDH1  , which is frequently downregulated in tumor progression and EMT 61 and implicated in lymph node metastasis 23. The resultant network Figure 5 showed that epigenetic changes could be identified at several of these gene loci  , including EGFR  , the lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin M CST6 60 and the transcriptional repressors ZEB2 and SNAI2.Thus  , the simplest hypothesis to explain the results shown in Figure 2 is that three genes existed before the ascomycetes/basidiomycetes split. It is very significant that  , except for some species-specific duplicates  , all fungi have three cullin genes.The blue arrow denotes the amino acid residue mutated in the scs9 mutant. The predicted catalytic tetrad K-D-K-E is labeled with red asterisks and red shading.The residue G130 was the most exchangeable amino acid  , and could thus be most easily substituted non-synonymously Additional file 3: Figure S3C. Our protein model showed that amino acid alterations at specific ligand-binding sites have a negative effect on protein function  , including modifications at P11  , D13  , V41  , G127  , G130  , G140  , and S/T141.One novel finding of this study is that BMP2/4 and chordin are co-expressed in the ventral ectoderm of the embryo. Thus  , it indicates that although a BMP Chordin axis is present in the sea urchin embryo  , this axis is defined by the activities of these factors and not by their expression territory.The cullin domain-containing APC2 proteins will not be considered here  , given that their similarity with canonical cullins was too low. Once excluded partial sequences < 300 amino acids  , duplicates or nearly identical sequences ≥ 99% identity and highly divergent sequences that could not be reliably aligned along the whole length of the selected region  , I generated a database containing 490 sequences available as Additional File 1.Therefore  , BMP2/4-Chordin complexes diffuse or are transported toward the dorsal side resulting in formation of a shallow D/V gradient of BMP2/4 signaling. High levels of Chordin on the ventral side prevent BMP2/4 from binding to its receptor.In this study  , we examined the range of BMP2/4 signaling in embryos treated with the Nodal receptor inhibitor SB431542 that prevents chordin expression. Therefore  , our data argue in favor of free diffusion of BMP ligands in early embryos.They also show that although genes used for D/V patterning such as BMP2/4 and chordin are conserved in this organism  , the relationships between their expression patterns are dramatically different from what was described so far in other models. These results allow us to provide a new model for patterning along the D/V axis of the sea urchin embryo Figure 11.Cullin-3–dependent E3 ligases use BTB domain containing proteins for substrate recognition 44 ,45 ,49. These results identify Klhl10 as a potential partner of Cul3Testis in spermatids.Dmrt1expression was downregulated T. Ectopic Chordin expression was stronger in anterior ectoderm than in posterior ectoderm possibly reflecting the difference in expression levels between anterior and posterior expressing cells in control embryos.If Klhl10 is indeed a physiologically relevant Cullin-3 binding partner in vivo  , mutations in klhl10 should affect the function of this E3 complex and thus block caspase activation. Collectively  , these results suggest that Cul3Testis interacts functionally and physically with Roc1b and Klhl10 to promote caspase activation and spermatid individualization in Drosophila.It is very significant that  , except for some species-specific duplicates  , all fungi have three cullin genes. Figure 2 shows the main groups detected for which there is bootstrap support.No indels were observed between amino acid positions 46 and 186 constant amino acid positions Y1 and Y2; Fig. Thus  , slight length variation occurred either within the first 45 amino acid positions  , or at the C-terminus end i.e.  , the two Quadrula MCOX2e sequences were one amino acid shorter than the others due to the deletion of the terminal residue.Another hypothesis is that in the two radially symmetrical organisms  , the sea urchin and the sea anemone  , BMP signaling may have evolved independently on the basis of co-expression. That chordin and BMP2/4-dpp are expressed in the same territory both in embryos of a basal deuterostome and in embryos of N. Vectensis raises the intriguing possibility that co-expression of BMP ligands and BMP antagonists such as Chordin on the same side of the embryo could have been the ancestral way to develop a secondary axis and the switch to opposite expression territories for the ligand and the antagonist a more recent evolutionary innovation.Loss of skr-1/2 strongly and specifically attenuates induction of SKN-1 dependent genes independent of p38 MAPK signaling and reduces survival of pro-oxidants. SKR-1/2 are highly conserved orthologues of Skp1  , a component of many protein complexes including the Skp-Cullin-F box ubiquitin ligase SCF that regulates cell cycle progression and differentiation 23 ,24.Particularly significant are cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases CRLs  , a diverse group of E3 complexes characterized by containing both a cullin family protein and a RING finger-containing protein. However  , in other cases the ubiquitin ligase function is performed by multiprotein complexes.Comparative RT-PCR experiments were performed using specific primers in the unique 5′ UTRs of cul3 and cul3 and a reverse primer in their common 3′ UTR black arrows in Figure 3A. To test this idea  , we examined the distribution of cullin-3 transcripts in the testis and the soma.Analyzing the incidence of the second most common amino acid residue showed that all 181 positions in the α1 and α2 domains of HLA-A  , -B and -C exhibit some variation. This reflects functional specialization of the three HLA class I.While Msxb  , Delta2 and Chordin expression in the b6.5 lineage starts at the 64-cell stage st. 8  , we analyzed early gastrula stages st. 10/11 because expression is much stronger and more readily detectable by in situ hybridization. For P. mammillata: Msxb AHC0AAA214YL10RM1 and Delta2 AHC0AAA62YG24RM1.MS/MS spectra showed the additional 14 Da on the alkylated cysteine residue 138 data not shown. The mass spectrometry spectra showed the presence of an isoform at the N139 glycopeptide with a difference in mass of 14 Da in the amino acid backbone.As shown in Figure 4B  , the csn-3 mutant had a Myc-Cul3 neddylated/deneddylated pattern that was similar to that in the wild-type strain  , whereas in the other csn knockout mutants  , Myc-Cul3 was hyperneddylated. We further examined the neddylation states of two other N. crassa cullin proteins  , Cul3 and Cul4  , in the wild-type strain and csn mutants.The loss of cystatin M expression is associated with the progression of primary tumors to a metastatic phenotype 3 ,4 ,7. Cystatin M is abundantly expressed in normal and premalignant breast epithelium  , but its expression has been reported to be diminished or lost in breast cancers 3-7.The amino acid sequences surrounding the eIF2α phosphorylation site are identical in S. cerevisiae  , C. elegans and humans  , suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism of eIF2α 28. Gcn1p and Gcn20p form a protein complex that activates the serine-threonine protein kinase Gcn2p  , which then phosphorylates an evolutionarily conserved serine residue of eIF2α.In addition  , in both Aqp1a and Aqp1b amino acid sequences  , the Cys residue were before the second NPA motif Cys178 for sea bream Aqp1a and Aqp1b  , which is the site in mammalian AQP1 potentially responsible for the inhibition of water permeability by mercurial compounds 18. Comparison of the primary structure of AQP1-like polypeptides between human and teleosts Figure 3 indicated that Aqp1a and Aqp1b sequences have the six potential transmembrane domains and the two NPA motifs  , as well as the residues of the pore-forming region Phe56  , His180 and Arg195; human AQP1 numbering that are conserved in water-selective AQPs 17.In Drosophila  , two closely related Roc1 proteins  , Roc1a and Roc1b  , were reported to play differential roles during development 42 ,43. The Cullin proteins  , via their C-terminal regions  , bind to the RING-domain protein Roc1-Rbx1-Hrt1  , which recruits an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 31.Importantly  , some classes of NMDA receptors also lack the 3rd residue 22. Moreover  , AgIR25 has retained 2 of the 3 amino acids  , an arginine and an aspartic acid Figure 9A  , in positions that are known to be important for glutamate binding 22.However  , a role of these proteins in caspase regulation has not yet been reported. Cullin-3–based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes were previously implicated in various biological processes  , including cell-cycle control and both Hedgehog and Wnt signaling 78 ,82–85.Feather β-keratins are fibrous proteins that have four repeating units of two β-sheets that form a helical structure. Based on sequence similarity  , this 32 amino acid residue has also been identified in the β-keratins of scales and claws from reptiles and birds in addition to the chicken  , suggesting that it is an important region and should be under intense purifying selection.Hence NORK has undergone relatively few rearrangement events within the Hologalegina clade 17. Outside Medicago there are only two additional short insertion/deletion events: a two-residue insertion at positions 214–215 common to all Medicago and a single amino acid insertion/deletion at position 373 the only insertion occurring outside the 200–241 range.ATR plays a central role in cell-cycle regulation  , transmitting DNA damage signals to downstream effectors 31. The control of DDB1A nuclear translocation by the ATR kinase and subsequently DDB2 turnover illustrates a novel and specific level of regulation of Cullin-based E3 ligase complex activity.Like the vertebrate Chordin and Drosophila Sog proteins  , the sea urchin Chordin protein contains a hydrophobic leader sequence and four cysteine rich regions that are present in the same relative positions Figure 7A and Figure S4. We thus isolated a P.lividus cDNA encoding Chordin and examined the expression of this gene during early development of the sea urchin embryo.For P. mammillata: Msxb AHC0AAA214YL10RM1 and Delta2 AHC0AAA62YG24RM1. Dig-labeled probes were synthesized from the following cDNAs for C. intestinalis: Msxb cign067l18  , Delta2 cieg005o22  , Chordin cign055j01  , Nodal cicl090l02  , Dmrt1 ciad017d15  , Klf1/2/4 citb012d14  , KH.C7.391 cilv038e26 69  , Otx
27 and Ap2-like2 cien223529 Rothbächer et al.  , in preparation.Therefore  , it is possible that other factors can substitute for the TeNC domain to promote the assembly of a similar Cullin-3–based E3 complex in species or tissues that do not express the TeNC domain. However  , there is some indication that Cullin-3 can regulate caspases in tissues that do not contain a TeNC domain see below.Consistent with this  , CST6  , which encodes the cysteine protease inhibitor  , cystatin M  , has been shown to be silenced following DNA methylation of CpG islands located within the promoter region  , but not within exon 1 41. This supports the well established concept that the location of the CpG dinucleotides subjected to methylation plays an important role in determining whether genes are silenced or not.Through a series of gene deletion and protein interaction experiments  , the researchers identified two proteins Roc1b and Klhl10 that form a complex with Cullin-3 to promote caspase activation and spermatid individualization in the fruit fly. Fruit flies and mammals share many aspects of spermatid individualization  , and human fertility requires the Cullin-3 enzyme complex.To provide independent evidence for a requirement of Cullin-3 in caspase activation  , we measured DEVDase activity in cul3 mutant testes. We have previously shown that wild-type adult testes also contain DEVDase activity and that this activity is reduced in cyt-c-d mutant testes 50.These results confirm that cullin-3 is required for the activation of effector caspases in spermatids. Whereas lysates of wild-type testes displayed significant levels of DEVDase activity  , activity in cul3 mutant testes was reduced to background levels  , comparable to the reduction achieved with the potent caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk Figure 1I and 1J.Because the Drosophila cullin-3 gene was previously termed gft 71  , we will henceforth refer to the lethal cullin-3 alleles as cul3. We then performed similar complementation tests with available mutants in this region and found that lethal cullin-3 mutants 70 ,71 failed to complement the sterility of mds mutant males  , suggesting that the mds alleles may represent a unique class of mutations in the cullin-3 gene see below  , Table S1.Putative T3SS effector genes were identified in the Q8r1-96  , A506  , SS101 and BG33R genomes based on the presence of possible Hrp boxes and N-termini typical of T3SS-secreted proteins i.e.  , abundance of Ser and polar residues at the N-termini  , only one acidic residue in the first 12 positions  , and an aliphatic amino acid in position 3 or 4. The six genomes also were screened using hidden Markov models HMMs built from the compilation of P. syringae Hrp boxes.Table 1 shows the functional data that also support the early emergence of three cullin genes. Table 1 also supports the idea that S. cerevisiae CUL8/RTT101 is indeed  , and in spite of the low sequence similarity shown in Figure 2  , a true ortholog of the Cul4 genes in other fungi  , given its interaction with a DDB-like protein 49.When testing the hypothesis that some codon sites within chemokine receptor coding sequences have experienced positive selection pressure  , significant results were obtained for some codons within the genes CCR2 and CCR3 Table 1. Eight of the nine amino acids identified as having experienced positive selection in the coding sequence of CCR2 are located in extracellular domains of the protein; one positively selected amino acid residue is located in the second transmembrane domain  , near the transmembrane/extracellular boundary Figure 1.Furthermore  , patient prognosis according to cystatin M loss was not analyzed due to a short period of follow-up. For the quantitative analysis of methylation status in IBC  , this study was severely limited by the small number of fresh-frozen tissues 51 samples which may have led to an incorrect conclusion between ER expression and CST6 methylation.We attempted to identify residues in this region that could be freely replaced with non-natural amino acid analogs in order to improve pharmacological properties of the lead peptides. Therefore  , we generated and tested several longer  , 10-residue peptides encompassing the 149-166 adiponectin stretch.The authors identify a region in the dorsal ectoderm of the blastula that they name the “blastula Chordin- and Nogginexpressing” or BCNE region Figure 2. 2004 adds much information about neural specification before gastrulation in Xenopus and the factors involved in this process.We had access to 129 skeletal muscle biopsies taken at age 70 years in 1992 and we processed these in 2012 with the majority having excellent NUSE plot profiles. Renal function was estimated using cystatin C  , which is a marker of glomerular filtration rate 4.Another amino acid position that has evolved under positive selection  , residue 243  , is located just four positions upstream of a A247S human disease mutation which has been linked to oral cancer susceptibility 43  , and three positions downstream of the human Q240P polymorphism these two sites are underlined in the human amino acid sequence. Residue 211  , which was identified as being subject to positive selection  , lies at the third position within the SUMOylation consensus site IKQE; denoted in red  , with the neighboring lysine being SUMOylated 41.The methylation level at each CpG in tumor tissues was adjusted by subtracting the quantity of methylated CpGs in matched normal tissue from that of methylated CpGs in tumor tissue. The association between the quantity of CST6 methylation and the expression statuses of cystatin M  , ER  , PR  , and HER4 in tumor tissues was analyzed Figure 4B.A Genomic organization of the cullin-3 locus. cul3 contains a five-nucleotide deletion that results in a premature stop codon at amino acid 748 that removes half of the C-terminal Cullin homology domain CHD.Consistent with these observations  , in situ hybridization revealed that during blastula and gastrula stages  , the chordin Figure 7Cii–x and BMP2/4 genes Figure 7Cxi–xiv are transcribed in highly similar patterns within the ventral ectoderm  , the BMP2/4 territory being slightly larger than the chordin expression domain at mesenchyme blastula and gastrula stages. Chordin transcripts are downregulated in embryos treated with the vegetalizing agent lithium or in cultures of dissociated blastomeres but are overexpressed in embryos treated with the ventralizing agent nickel chloride Figure 7B.A Blocking Chordin function using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides severely perturbs D/V polarity. Injection of chordin mRNA causes the opposite effect and eliminates tbx2/3 expression n = 29 at the mesenchyme blastula stage iv.The previously reported preferences for aliphatic residues at positions +1 and +2 the aa in CaaX were recovered  , but there is a clear tendency for other residue types to also be allowed  , especially at position +1 the first a in CaaX. Compositional analysis of residue frequencies at single motif positions reveals that major restrictions to specific amino acid types exist only for positions within the CaaX box see sequence logos in Figure 1.The amino acid in position 181 is the cysteine C6c the twelfth cysteine residue in all plus-C sequences except in those associated with OBP50a  , where a cysteine was replaced by asparagine. For plus-C OBP50a  , we found the largest number of positively selected sites: nine sites  , four of them located in the protein core region.In 30% of the embryos it inhibited development of the dorsal region and caused a strong radialization as indicated by the formation of ectopic spicules throughout the circumference of the embryo Figure 8Axii  , xiii. Overexpression of chordin strongly affected D/V polarity Figure 8Axi–xv.Loss of cullin-3 function causes an increase in the number of Drosophila sensory organ precursors and external sensory organs 71. There is some evidence that the somatic isoforms of Cullin-3 may also regulate caspase activity in other tissues.At position 318 where the human PSEN1 contains a non-pathogenic polymorphism  , E318G  , a Q residue is present at the equivalent positions in pig  , cow  , and mouse PSEN1 14. Mutations in human PSEN1 cause Alzheimer's disease and it is noteworthy that none of the amino acid changes between pig and human are located in positions known to cause Alzheimer's disease Figure 1.To test this possibility  , we examined the neddylation status of three N. crassa cullin proteins: Cul1  , Cul3  , and Cul4. The distinct phenotypes of each csn mutant suggest that they may contribute differently to this particular CSN function.reported that both overexpression of chordin and injection of the chordin morpholino strongly perturbed D/V polarity and suppressed formation of the dorsal side and oral arms  , but surprisingly these perturbations did not affect tbx2/3 expression at late gastrula stage. Bradham et al.An in vitro splicing assay may resolve the importance of the second to last A residue of the exon 1 of B4GALT7 for proper splicing. This mutation did not alter the encoded amino acid and it stresses the importance of the exonic terminal nucleotide sequences for splicing at particular junctions.In Arabidopsis there are 11 BTB-BACK domain proteins. In this context it is postulated that the BACK domain may serve as a bridge between Cullin interaction and substrate orientation for optimal ubiquitin attachment.If Diap1 was a substrate for Cullin-3–mediated protein degradation  , we would have expected to see an increase of this protein in cul3 mutants. However  , it appears that Diap1 is not the major caspase inhibitor in this context.To further test whether the endogenous BMP signaling machinery is functional in p18ahub embryos  , including the endogenous BMP ligands  , mutant embryos were injected with translation-blocking morpholinos MOs targeting the secreted BMP antagonists Chordin  , Noggin1  , and Follistatin-like 2b 54. Thus  , endogenous BMP ligands can signal in p18ahub embryos at a WT or greater level if BMP ligand function is permitted.These effects were suppressed by inhibition of Nodal signaling through Lefty overexpression M-O except for Dmrt1 P. FGF9/16/20 overexpression using the pFOG promoter via electroporation led to ectopic expression of Msxb E and Delta2 F throughout posterior ectoderm  , of Chordin G through most of the ectoderm except the anterior-most part and of Dmrt1 H throughout anterior ectoderm at early gastrula stages st. 10/11.The lack of association between cystatin M loss and hypermethylation of the CST6 gene may be due to the density dependence of methylated CpGs on transcriptional silencing by CST6 methylation or the inconsistence of methylation status between primer binding sites and other CpG sites within PCR product. No association was also found between CST6 methylation and cystatin M loss in DCISs P = 0.38 or IBCs P = 0.50 Figure 3D.Amino acid sequence alignment of the divergent domains from the CELF family proteins in C. elegans and human. An arrowhead indicates the amino acid residue substituted in the Yellow mutant allele unc-75 yb1698.Ectopic Chordin expression was stronger in anterior ectoderm than in posterior ectoderm possibly reflecting the difference in expression levels between anterior and posterior expressing cells in control embryos. Overexpression of Nodal using the pFOG driver was sufficient to activate Msxb Q and Delta2 R in the neural plate  , and Chordin S throughout the ectoderm.D Full BUL2 RM allele replacement and single nucleotide point mutation encoding the BUL2 L883F substitution both confer ADCB resistance in the BY strain background. C Alignment of amino acid sequences from Bul2 homologs identifies a leucine substitution of a conserved phenylalanine residue at position 883 conferred by the BY allele of BUL2 T2647C.Taken together  , these data indicate that CSN is important for maintaining the stability of DCAF11 in N. crassa  , probably by preventing its autoubiquitination. These observations suggest that the CSN-3 subunit is also required to maintain the function of intact CSN complexes in protecting cullin-RING E3 ligase adaptor proteins from autoubiquitination.Interestingly this phenotype is also identical to the phenotype obtained following partial inhibition of Alk4/5/7 function using low doses of the SB431542 inhibitor  , which strongly reduce chordin expression Figure 8Av  , x and unpublished data. These phenotypes abnormal patterning of the ectoderm in the animal hemisphere and parallel growth of the spicules were consistently observed following injection of a second non-overlapping morpholino directed against the 5′ UTR of the chordin transcript Mo2 chordin Figure 8Aiv  , ix.In other systems  , secreted BMP inhibitors such as Chordin in vertebrates or Sog in Drosophila are key regulators of the activity of BMP signals that sequester BMP ligands and prevent them from binding to and activating their receptors while allowing them to diffuse over long distances 1. The finding that BMP2/4 is produced on the ventral side but that BMP signaling is active on the dorsal side raised two intriguing questions: what prevents BMP2/4 from signaling in ventral cells and what promotes diffusion of BMP2/4 towards the dorsal side ?GR also contains a methionine residue at this position  , raising the possibility that it may also employ induced fit to broaden motif recognition. Of these  , methionine  , the only unbranched hydrophobic amino acid and the most accommodating  , at a key position between the +1 and +5 sites  , allows the AR AF-2 interface to vary the size and shape of its pockets to associate with a more diverse set of coregulators.Replacing each amino acid individually revealed one critical amino acid residue with regards to regulation of AQY2/ncFRE6. Indeed the collection of all four mutations is sufficient to rescue expression in S288c .Kinetic partitioning between OM incorporation and aggregation of periplasmic OMP intermediates may explain the observation that OMPs with a defective C-terminal recognition sequence are assembled into the OM at low expression levels 36. However  , the latter explanation seems less likely  , since  , in contrast to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 12 amino acid residues of PhoE  , similar peptides lacking the C-terminal Phe or containing a positively charged residue at the penultimate position did not affect Omp85 channel properties at all.In the absence of the C-terminal Phe  , Omp85 may recognize  , though less efficiently  , internal β-strands  , many of which also end with an aromatic residue 38. The last ten amino acid residues of PhoE form an amphipathic β-strand.Clearly  , experimental evidence is required to prove/disprove the possibility that these proteins indeed represent novel type III effectors. These genes encode conserved hypothetical proteins with N-termini typical of T3SS-secreted proteins i.e.  , abundance of Ser and polar residues at the N-termini  , only one acidic residue in the first 12 positions  , and an aliphatic amino acid in position 3 or 4Table S15  , Figure 6.This catalytic base associates with a substrate adaptor called an F box protein  , of which humans encode at least 69. The SCF is a cullin-RING ligase CRL containing 3 core catalytic subunits: the RING finger protein RBX1  , the cullin CUL1 and the adaptor SKP1 14–17.The budding yeast cul8 mutants cullin 8 is thought to be the functional homologue of cullin 4 in S. cerevisae also accumulate DNA damage 82. For example  , DDB1- and/or CUL4A-depleted human cells accumulate DSBs and have an activated ATM-ATR cell cycle checkpoint 81.Msxb  , Delta2 and Chordin are more likely to be indirect targets of FGF as they are activated later at the 64-cell stage. In addition  , a previously identified b6.5-specific Nodal enhancer has the same regulatory logic as the FGF-responsive enhancer of the direct FGF target gene Otx
30.YOL086C ADH1 encodes alcohol dehydrogenase I  , the constitutive enzyme primarily responsible for producing ethanol during yeast fermentation of glucose de Smidt et al. Two other S. cerevisiae strains have a 7-residue addition with another 11 new amino acid residues created via frameshift.Moreover  , a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acid residues of PhoE also caused Omp85-channel opening  , like the complete PhoE protein did. Indeed  , we found that the C-terminal Phe residue plays an important role in the recognition by Omp85  , since a mutant PhoE lacking this residue  , PhoEΔF330  , did not open  , but  , at high concentrations  , even completely blocked the Omp85 channel.Another candidate is the giant  , 4852–amino acid-long  , IAP-like protein dBruce. These data are consistent with the idea that dBruce is a substrate for the Cullin-3-based E3-ligase complex.The biological meaning of the cutoff criteria for positive expression that was adopted in this study was not clear  , and poorly justified cutoffs may lead to wrong conclusions and contribute to non-reproducibility of results. Taken together  , the present study suggests that cystatin M loss in IBC may be associated with triple negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4.On the other hand  , the theoretical isoelectric point pI  , arginine residue number  , and protease cutting sites in the amino acid sequence of cv-lysozyme 3 were closer to those of cv-lysozyme 2 56-58. It  , along with its apparent ortholog cg-lysozyme 4  , also shared a unique N-terminal domain with cv-lysozyme 1 that is absent in cv-lysozyme 2 and all other bivalve i-type lysozymes Figure 5.Fortunately  , and in spite of this extensive variability  , analyses in multiple species has allowed to classify all complexes known so far into a few main CRL classes: 1 the Cullin/RING/Skp/F-box CRLs historically known as SCF complexes  , and to which I will refer generically as F-box CRLs that contain proteins with F boxes as substrate receptors and Skp1 or related proteins as adaptors; 2 the Cullin/RING/BTB CRLs BTB CRLs  , characterized by lacking additional adaptors and containing proteins with BTB domains as substrate receptors  , directly bound to the cullins; 3 the Cullin/RING/DDB/DCAFs CRLs DDB CRLs that contain proteins related to mammalian DDB1 as adaptors and often proteins with WD40 domains as substrate receptors; and  , 4 Cullin/RING/Elongins/BC-box CRLs BC-box CRLs  , which contain one or two elongin proteins as adaptors and BC-box/SOCS-box containing proteins as substrate receptors see reviews 5-9. The number of CRLs may be very large: in all eukaryotic species analyzed in detail so far there are several cullins  , related RING finger-containing proteins  , several adaptors and  , most especially  , many alternative substrate receptors e. g. potentially  , there may be several hundreds in mammals that participate in CRLs.cul3w plants also showed normal meiotic development of male meiocytes not shown. Next  , considering cullin 3 activity  , we analysed the CUL3a/3b hypomorphic mutant cul3w cul3a3cul3b1 described for its defects in various aspects of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway and root development 63.CUL5 codes for the cullin 5 protein  , which is recruited by HIV-1 viral infectivity factor vif to form a protein complex that functions as an ubiquitin ligase. Of the four HGAHs detected by our method as being under putative selection in the Biaka 20  , CUL5 demonstrated the strongest signal of selection Figure 2 and Additional file 1: Figure S3.Here  , we describe the identification of cullin-3 mutants from a genetic screen for mutants that abrogate effector caspase activation during terminal differentiation of Drosophila spermatids. However  , very little is known about their involvement in the regulation of caspase activation and apoptosis.Although mutations in many genes are known to affect male fertility  , several observations indicate that the genes described here play a direct and important role in caspase regulation. Loss-of-function mutations in either a testis-specific isoform of cullin-3  , the small RING protein Roc1b  , or the BTB-Kelch protein Klhl10  , all reduce or eliminate effector caspase activation in spermatids  , are defective in spermatid individualization  , and are male-sterile.Consistent with phenotypic analysis results  , our molecular analyses demonstrated that CSN-3 was not required for cullin deneddylation  , while deletion of any of the other six csn genes caused hyperneddylation of all three cullins  , indicating that in N. crassa  , these six CSN subunits were essential for cleavage of Nedd8 from the cullins of CRLs in vivo. These results  , together with the findings of the present study  , indicate that different subunits may have different roles in the CSN complex.Gcn1p and Gcn20p form a protein complex that activates the serine-threonine protein kinase Gcn2p  , which then phosphorylates an evolutionarily conserved serine residue of eIF2α. In S. cerevisiae  , Gcn1p and Gcn20p are required for the efficient phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 eIF2α under both normal conditions and conditions of amino-acid starvation 29  , 30.Although correlations higher than 0.6 can only be obtained for aliphatic property at position +2 FT: 0.85  , GGT1: 0.87  , the average aliphatic property at position +1 within both FT and GGT1 learning sets still appears elevated when compared to an average calculated from the carboxy-termini of the nonredundant UniRef50 database 22 see physical property profile in Figure 1. Correlation analysis of residue frequencies at single motif positions with amino-acid property scales 20 ,21 can quantify the conservation of a physical property pattern see Materials and methods.The RNase P proteins of the free-living F. psychrophilum
20  , Flavobacterium johnsoniae http://genome.jgi-psf.org/flajo/flajo.info.html and Gramella forsetii
21 contain a lysine residue at that position. The only pseudogene found corresponds to the protein component of RNase P. This gene coding for 118 amino acids is disrupted by an in-frame stop codon at amino acid position 53.In fission yeast  , mutation in Ddb1 increases the spontaneous mutation rate by more than 20-fold and prevents premeiotic S phase entry 83. The budding yeast cul8 mutants cullin 8 is thought to be the functional homologue of cullin 4 in S. cerevisae also accumulate DNA damage 82.Transheterozygous combinations between cul3 and four strong gft alleles—cul3  , cul3  , cul3  , and cul3—were sterile  , and their elongated spermatids were CM1-negative but AXO 49–positive Figure 2E  , 2G  , 2H  , Table S1  , and unpublished data. Collectively  , these results suggest that a testis-specific isoform of cullin-3 is required for effector caspase activation and spermatid individualization.Arrows point out FWD-1 protein bands. Densitometric analyses from four independent experiments showing the degradation of Cullin 1 D  , SKP-1 E  , and FWD-1 F.Nodal activation at the 32-cell stage was a likely direct consequence of FGF signaling. Msxb  , Delta2 and Chordin are more likely to be indirect targets of FGF as they are activated later at the 64-cell stage.Cullins are major components of another type of E3 ubiquitin ligase that serve as scaffolds for two functional modules: a catalytic module  , composed of a small RING domain protein that recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  , and a substrate recognition module that binds to the substrate and brings it within proximity to the catalytic module 41 ,42. Here we provide evidence that a Cullin-3–based multiprotein complex plays a critical role in caspase activation in Drosophila.Our combined experiments identified >9 ,000 different phosphorylation sites on nearly 2 ,000 ookinete proteins. Importantly  , by comparing two parasite lines in the presence of C2 that differed in only a single amino acid  , the gatekeeper residue of PKG  , we could focus our analysis on on-target effects of the inhibitor.A prime example of this is provided when we focused on the set of 120 Chk1-target phospho-peptides displaying a basic residue Lys or Arg at position -3 Figure 2g. Yet further amino acid residue biases became evident when we analyzed subsets of Chk1 target sequences.Gcn1p and Gcn20p activate the serine-threonine protein kinase Gcn2p  , which phosphorylates an evolutionarily conserved serine residue of eIF2α. The yeast GCN-1 homolog Gcn1p and ABCF-3 homolog Gcn20p are required to maintain the basal level of the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α eIF2α in the physiological condition and to increase the phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to amino-acid starvation.We identified four different cullin-3 transcripts  , three of which are somatic and share the same coding region  , and one male germ-cell–specific transcript. Therefore  , it is possible that other factors can substitute for the TeNC domain to promote the assembly of a similar Cullin-3–based E3 complex in species or tissues that do not express the TeNC domain.To map the mds alleles  , we first searched for genomic deletions that failed to complement the sterility of the mds males. Therefore  , to the best of our knowledge  , cul3 represents the first tissue-specific Cullin identified in any organism.An inspection of the amino acid sequence of σE in regions 2.2 and 2.3 revealed an asparagine residue located at position 100 i.e.  , at the beginning of region 2.3 and conserved among all of Bacillus σE orthologues. To more precisely delineate the determinants for CsfB binding to σE  , we sought to identify residues that are necessary for the interaction.We therefore examined whether loss of roc1b function affects caspase activation and individualization of spermatids. Furthermore  , Cullin-3 preferentially co-immunoprecipitates with Roc1b  , indicating that both proteins form a complex 74.Ubiquitination is a critical process in all eukaryotic organisms. The CRL complexes also often contain one or more adaptor proteins  , which at the same time bind the cullin and recruit the substrate receptor 5 ,6.FGF9/16/20 overexpression using the pFOG promoter via electroporation led to ectopic expression of Msxb E and Delta2 F throughout posterior ectoderm  , of Chordin G through most of the ectoderm except the anterior-most part and of Dmrt1 H throughout anterior ectoderm at early gastrula stages st. 10/11. Expression of posterior neural markers Msxb A  , Delta2 B  , and Chordin C and of the anterior neural marker Dmrt1 D in control embryos.Genomic DNA 2 μg was used to amplify overlapping fragments from the cullin-3 or klhl10 loci in wild-type and homozygote mutant lines. Genomic DNA was isolated from 25–50 adult flies using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit Roche; http://www.roche.com.The c.363–364insG insertion is predicted to result in a frameshift beginning with amino acid residue 124 in the bovine SUOX protein sequence p.Ala124GlyfsX42. A single case of human sulfocysteinuria caused by a 1 bp deletion of human SUOX leading to a truncated protein has been reported  , where some dysmorphic skeletal features were diagnosed in addition to severe neurodevelopmental anomalies 22.This indicates that in a SB431542 context and therefore even in the absence of the carrier protein Chordin  , BMP2/4 is widely diffusible and can trigger long-range signaling within the ectoderm. In contrast  , injection of BMP2/4 mRNA at the two-cell stage combined with SB431542 treatment resulted in a dramatic increase of nuclear pSmad1/5/8 staining  , all cells of the ectoderm displaying strong nuclear staining Figure 9Bxiii–xx.It is involved in several metabolic pathways  , including gluconeogenesis or fatty acid and amino acid catabolism  , as a carboxyl carrier covalently linked to a specific lysine residue of a group of decarboxylases. Biotin or vitamin H is a small hydrosoluble molecule produced by plants and a large number of prokaryotic organisms.Covariates with a P-value of <0.25 in the univariate analysis or any variables that were considered to be biologically important were subjected to the multivariate analysis. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between cystatin M loss and any covariates found to be statistically significant in the univariate analysis  , and to calculate odds ratios ORs.In addition  , in some cases genes were named identically while being described independently in different species -- typically the names included the term cullin plus a consecutive number -- without considering at all their relationships. A typical one is the assignation of the same names to genes in different species just because the proteins that they encode belong to complexes with similar units for example  , similar adaptors and substrate receptors  , without any data actually supporting that those genes are orthologous.The T1 copper and the trinuclear copper cluster are highlighted in orange. A Amino acid residue asparagine 316 is shown in yellow; glycine 500 is shown in red.The substituting amino acids were norvaline for aliphatic residues  , D-asparagine for residues with amide-side chain  , D-serine for hydroxy-amino acids  , D-lysine for cationic residues and 1-amino cyclopentane carboxylic acid for aromatic residues and proline. In these 10-residue-long overlapping peptides  , residues 1  , 4  , 7 and 10 of the first array were replaced with non-natural amino acids.Amino acid size depicts fold enrichment positive  , above y-axis or under-representation negative  , below y-axis after normalization to amino acid occurrences in the human proteome. The x-axis represents the sequence window  , with the phosphorylated residue in the middle.However  , more complex alternatives  , with some genes disappearing and others emerging in multiple lineages can also be put forward to explain those results. Data presented in the previous section are compatible with the presence of at least three cullin genes before the unikont/bikont split  , followed by lineage-specific duplications.The modular architecture of SCF complex is apparently shared by several other cullin-RING E3 complexes  , such as Cul3  , that directly interact with a family of substrate receptors through their common BTB domain  , which has a Skp1-like structural fold 12. We further show that FWD-1 stability and levels were drastically reduced in the csn-3 mutant and other csn mutants  , confirming that CSN-3 was required for preventing autoubiquitination of FBPs after destruction of their substrates.The pattern for initial methionine cleavage is standard and depends on the steric hindrance of the second amino acid residue. Out of the 173 proteins  , 70 exhibit a methionine at their amino terminus  , 98 start with another amino acid  , and 5 are found in both forms Table S10 in Additional data file 3.These findings provide valuable information to understand the evolution of the pathways used for D/V axis specification in the ancestor of deuterostomes. They also show that although genes used for D/V patterning such as BMP2/4 and chordin are conserved in this organism  , the relationships between their expression patterns are dramatically different from what was described so far in other models.Since the Kozak consensus sequence is present at the second Met of the 17th amino acid residue S4 Fig  , the FGD3 variant probably produces an N-terminal 16 amino acid-truncated protein. In contrast  , the three non-synonymous SNPs in FDG3 caused loss of the start codon ATG to ACG and an amino acid substitution from His-171 CAC to Cys TGC.Amino Acid Alignment of β-keratins showing the 32aa Filament Segment of Feathers: Alignment of the two most diverged feather β-keratins from each chromosome of G. gallus and T. guttata. Both the G. gallus and T. guttata β-keratins possess a deletion in position 3 of the 32-residue segment.The association between the quantity of CST6 methylation and the expression statuses of cystatin M  , ER  , PR  , and HER4 in tumor tissues was analyzed Figure 4B. The quantities of methylated CpGs between normal and tumor tissues were usually different Figure 4A.4B2A1 was originally misaligned regarding α chain residue 82. Amino acid positions mutated are indicated by colour code according to the source  , orange23 and green 24  , and the resulting residues are indicated at each position.Similarly  , this residue is conserved in other solute carrier family 5 SLC5 paralogs in the horse which share similar structural homology Figure 3. This SNP is non-synonymous  , causing a P446L substitution in SLC5A3; this amino acid residue equivalent residue 451 in the human protein is conserved in all 11 placental mammals for which high-coverage sequence is now available selection shown in Figure 3.The third motif M3 LGGCFGxxC was also present towards the N-terminus of the Subtilisin S08.005 protein family. The second “x” position of this motif was occupied by a non-polar residue G Glycine in “Ophiocordycipitaceae” and “Nectriaceae” clades where as in “Cordycipitaceae/Clavicipitaceae” clade it was represented by a negatively charged amino acid residue D Aspartate.Species: Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae  , canary Serinus canaria  , chicken Gallus gallus  , duck Anas platyrhynchos  , egret Egretta garzetta  , emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri  , falcon Falco cherrug  , flycatcher Ficedula albicollis  , loon Gavia stellata  , mesite Mesitornis unicolor  , pigeon Columba livia  , ostrich Struthio camelus australis  , tinamou Tinamus guttatus  , zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata. x  , amino acid residue missing because of gaps in genome sequences.Notice the three groups in plants and stramenopiles and the multiple highly divergent groups in alveolata pink and excavata blue. Dendrogram of cullin sequences obtained from bikont species.The asymmetrical expression of dpp and chordin in the Nematostella embryo could therefore reflect the presence of a cryptic D/V axis or a convergent use of BMP signaling for secondary axis specification. It has been suggested that animals with a radial symmetry could have developed a secondary axis that was lost later during evolution 72.Further work will be necessary to understand possible mechanisms underlying the cystatin M loss by ER in breast cancer. These observations suggest that the effect of ER on cystatin M expression may not be mediated directly through ER-binding to the promoter of the CST6 gene.Under hypoxic conditions  , the VHL complex cannot bind HIFα for degradation because it is in the non-hydroxylated form. Under normal oxygen conditions  , the VHL protein forms a complex with elongin B  , elongin C  , and cullin 2 which targets hydroxylated hypoxia inducible factor-alpha HIFα for ubiquitin-mediated degradation 7  , 8.To determine the molecular nature of the mds alleles  , we sequenced PCR-amplified genomic fragments of the cullin-3 locus from these mutants. In contrast  , three of the lethal gft alleles that failed to complement the sterility of mds males—cul3  , cul3  , and cul3—contain mutations in exons 4  , 10  , and 11  , respectively  , that are shared by both isoforms of cullin-3 purple stars in Figure 1A; 71.The conserved SCF E3 ligase complex containing the RPM-1/Highwire RING protein negatively regulates the MAP kinase signaling or the receptor tyrosine kinase ALK to control synapse formation and homeostasis in C. elegans and Drosophila
32–34. An important RING E3 ligase is the SCF Skp1-Cullin-F-box E3 ligase composed of the adaptor Skp1  , the scaffold protein Cullin  , the RING-domain protein Roc1-Rbx1-Hrt1  , as well as the F-box protein for substrate recognition 31.The crude acid chloride was combined with tert-butyl 3R-3-3-chloropyridin-2-ylaminopiperidine-1-carboxylate 26.7 g  , 85.5 mmol in THF 250 mL and cooled to 0°C. The residue was diluted with toluene  , evaporated to dryness  , and dried under vacuum overnight.Overexpression of chordin strongly affected D/V polarity Figure 8Axi–xv. To further test if Chordin contributes to the establishment of the pSmad1/5/8 pattern  , we overexpressed it by mRNA injection into the egg.These changes were reflected at the protein level as determined by immunostaining of non-invasive IT lesions and broadly invasive IC2 lesions. We identified several components of desmosomes – Dsp  , Dsg2  , desmocollin 2 Dsc2; MGI: 103221  , and plakophilin 2 Pkp2; MGI: 1914701 – whose expression was significantly downregulated in the highly invasive tumor lesions that develop in the RT2 mouse model of PNET.We determined all amino acid residues that directly interact with a CPD residue  , requiring that the distance between their closest atoms does not exceed 4 Å in wild type or mutant. To identify CPDs  , both D. melanogaster wild type and mutant Suvar3-9 proteins were modelled according to known H3K9 HMTase crystal structures using the Swiss Model server 51.The latter is transcribed from a separate promoter and contains a unique first exon that encodes the N-terminal TeNC domain. We identified four different cullin-3 transcripts  , three of which are somatic and share the same coding region  , and one male germ-cell–specific transcript.The relative expression patterns of BMP and chordin in organisms belonging to the main clades of metazoan protostomes and deuteurostomes together with diploblastic cnidarians as outgroup are depicted. While in most organisms chordin and BMP are expressed in mutually exclusive patterns  , in the sea urchin and in cnidarians these genes are co-expressed on the same side of the embryo.Cullin-3–based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes were previously implicated in various biological processes  , including cell-cycle control and both Hedgehog and Wnt signaling 78 ,82–85. This shows that the Cul3-Roc1b-Klhl10 complex is required for activation of effector caspase  , but not for other individualization events  , such as axonemal tubulin polyglycylation.Due to the high divergence in the N-terminal region  , for the phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis we removed the region before the first cysteine residue in all sequences prior to the alignments  , as it was done in other studies 19  , 50–52. MAFFT also provided us with an identity matrix  , which we used to estimate the average amino acid identity by subfamily.Intriguingly  , additional differences in amino acid representation profiles were apparent when the set of Chk1 targets containing Arg/Lys at -3 was split into those containing phospho-Ser or phospho-Thr. Also clearly under-represented were acidic residues at -2 and -4 surrounding the basic residue at -3.To further demonstrate BCNE cells' independence from mesodermal signals  , the authors generate embryos without a mesoderm. The model that emerges from these experiments suggests that neural induction begins at the blastula stage  , with Chordin and Noggin signaling within the BCNE center and may later be consolidated or modulated by signals emanating from the organizer.The amino residue of amelogenin was used as the hydrophilic functional group  , and the stearic acid derivative was used as the hydrophobic tail. The oligopeptide amphiphile C18H35O-Thr-Lys-Arg-Glu-Glu-Val-Asp fabricated in this study consists of “two parts” hydrophilic C-terminal amino residue of amelogenin -Thr-Lys-Arg-Glu-Glu-Val-Asp and a derivative of stearic acid C18H35COOH Sigma-Aldrich  , St. Louis  , MO  , USA.The average quantities of methylated CpGs between groups with and without ER loss were 16.4% and 8.7%  , respectively. Average quantities of methylated CpGs in tumor tissues were significantly associated with cystatin M loss P = 0.008; Wilcoxon rank sum test or ER loss P = 0.0002; Wilcoxon rank-sum test.CSN negatively regulates the activities of cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligases by cleaving the Nedd8 modification from cullins 4  , 13. The neddylation status of these cullin proteins reflects the functional activity of the CSN complex in each strain.To rule out the possibility of a confounding effect of HER2 in the relationship between cystatin M loss and the triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4  , we stratified the data according to the expression status of HER2 and reanalyzed the relationship according to HER2. However  , cystatin M loss in IBCs was significantly associated with the triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4 P = 0.001; Figure 2A: cystatin M loss occurred in 20 87% of 23 triple-negative IBCs of ER  , PR  , and HER4 and in 79 52% of 152 other subtypes.The Sog/Cv-Tsg2 complex facilitates the movement of BMPs from the LVs through the extracellular space  , likely by protecting BMPs from binding to cell bound molecules such as their receptors 8–11. In order for this to occur  , the secreted BMPs must bind the D. melanogaster Chordin homolog Short gastrulation Sog and the Twisted gastrulation family member Crossveinless Cv  , termed here Cv-Tsg2 to avoid confusion with other “Cv” gene names.The mechanisms of BMP gradient formation have been best studied in Drosophila reviewed in 1. Furthermore  , experimental manipulations in Xenopus indicate that a shuttling mechanism of BMP ligands is responsible for translocation of BMP ligands ventrally through association with Chordin 50.Though in general cysteines are conserved in OBPs  , even highly conserved cysteine residues may be lost 17. The amino acid in position 181 is the cysteine C6c the twelfth cysteine residue in all plus-C sequences except in those associated with OBP50a  , where a cysteine was replaced by asparagine.Nodal signaling induces BMP2/4 and chordin expression in the ventral ectoderm. Our results allow us to propose a new model of D/V patterning by BMP signals in the sea urchin embryo Figure 11.Cystatin M is abundantly expressed in normal and premalignant breast epithelium  , but its expression has been reported to be diminished or lost in breast cancers 3-7. Cystatin M is a candidate tumor suppressor that functions as a physiological inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases.The negative and positive indicate the presence and absence of expression of each protein  , respectively. B The quantities of methylated CpGs in IBC show a significant association with the cystatin M loss P = 0.008 and ER loss P = 0.0002  , but not with the PR P = 0.64 or HER4 loss P = 0.87.A chordin and bmp2/4 are both expressed in the ventral ectoderm downstream of Nodal while the presumed Chordin protease Tolloid/BMP1 83  , the BMP2/4 receptor alk3/6  , and glypican 5 are expressed widely throughout the ectoderm at blastula stages. BMP signaling on the dorsal side up-regulates expression of glypican 5  , which may facilitate BMP2/4 mobility and BMP2/4 binding to its receptor  , thereby reinforcing BMP2/4 signaling via a positive feedback loop.On the other hand  , to date recombination methods have not been compared in detail. On average they can only achieve between 3.15–7.4 amino acid substitutions per residue 6.The amino acid sequence of the peptide derived from the hydrophilic C-terminal amino residue of amelogenin and acts as a functional domain to induce mineralization. The hydrophobic alkyl tails would pack together in the centre and leave the peptide segments exposed to the aqueous environment  , resulting in peptide amphiphile self-assembly.These data are consistent with the idea that dBruce is a substrate for the Cullin-3-based E3-ligase complex. Furthermore  , a tagged peptide with the first N-terminal 387 amino acids of dBruce that includes the BIR domain amino acids 251–321 is sufficient to bind to Klhl10 in this assay Figure 10C.Triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER2 was not associated with cystatin M loss  , but another triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4 was significantly associated with cystatin M loss in IBC  , suggesting a different role of HER4 independently of HER2. The HER2 is well known as a major player in initiation or progression of breast cancer  , but the significance of HER4 in breast cancer has not been studied extensively.BMP2/4 ligands expressed on the ventral side of the embryo are immediately complexed with Chordin and cannot bind to their receptors. A chordin and bmp2/4 are both expressed in the ventral ectoderm downstream of Nodal while the presumed Chordin protease Tolloid/BMP1 83  , the BMP2/4 receptor alk3/6  , and glypican 5 are expressed widely throughout the ectoderm at blastula stages.Thick bars indicate exons and dotted lines indicate introns. A Genomic organization of the cullin-3 locus.In the present study  , we show a physiological requirement of a cullin-3–based E3-ubiqutin ligase complex for caspase activation and sperm differentiation in Drosophila. This model is further supported by the findings that the Cullin-3–based complex and effector caspases are activated in a very similar spatiotemporal pattern in individualizing spermatids  , which is consistent with a direct link between effector caspase activation and protein ubiquitination in this system.A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to control for the potential confounding effects of variables  , such as age  , and to calculate odds ratio Table 2B. Cystatin M loss also occurred at a high prevalence in the PR-negative IBCs OR = 2.41  , 95% CI = 1.32 to 4.39; P = 0.007 as well as in the HER4-negative IBCs OR = 3.09  , 95% CI = 1.44 to 6.62; P = 0.003 than in the PR- or HER4-positive cases  , respectively.B The association between cystatin M loss and triple-negative IBCs was analyzed according to the expression status of HER2. A Cystatin M loss occurred at a higher prevalence in the triple-negative IBCs than in other subtypes P = 0.001.The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear but we feel that explanations may reside in the different doses of RNA used  , the different methods used for phenotypic characterization  , and the different stages analyzed. reported that both overexpression of chordin and injection of the chordin morpholino strongly perturbed D/V polarity and suppressed formation of the dorsal side and oral arms  , but surprisingly these perturbations did not affect tbx2/3 expression at late gastrula stage.The CRLs are activated by the neddylation process  , in which Nedd8  , a ubiquitin-like protein  , is attached to a conserved lysine site on cullin proteins. In eukaryotic systems  , CRLs play essential roles in many processes  , including cell division  , cell proliferation  , cell differentiation  , and circadian clock function 12.The resultant network Figure 5 showed that epigenetic changes could be identified at several of these gene loci  , including EGFR  , the lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin M CST6 60 and the transcriptional repressors ZEB2 and SNAI2. Given the marked morphological differences in vitro between these cell lines 39  , we mapped the biological association of 35 focus genes reported to be associated with EMT 40.In contrast with the situation in other bilaterian models  , however  , the territories expressing chordin and BMP2/4 are not complementary but are congruent. In addition  , we have examined the expression and function of sea urchin Chordin and found it to be necessary to prevent BMP signaling on the ventral side.D N-termini found in purified α2AP13-42-HSA by amino acid sequencing of the preparation shown in the leftmost lane of panel C. Numbers above the box identify every fifth amino acid residue in α2AP13-42-HSA. M  , markers  , same as in panel B.Here some variability was observed within a given experiment  , with about half of the embryos developing with the strong phenotype and the other half with the milder phenotype n>500; 5 experiments. Overexpression of chordin mRNA disrupted D/V patterning and caused complete xii  , xiii or partial xiv  , xv radialization.I–N Pie charts indicate fractions of embryos at 24 hpf that displayed the indicated phenotypes categories described in the text. Expression of the BMP antagonist chordin chd was confined to the dorsal side of WT embryos G  , n = 21 but was expanded around the entire margin of p18ahub embryos H  , n = 20 by early gastrulation.It is well established in many organisms that ubiquitin Ub is a key modifier of signalling. RING containing proteins can either ubiquitinate substrates independently or function as part of a multi-subunit complex which  , in plants  , includes: SCF Skp1-Cullin1-F-box  , CUL3 Cullin 3-BTB/POZ Bric a brac  , Tramtrack and Broad complex/Pox virus and Zinc finger  , CUL4-DDB1 UV-Damaged DNA-Binding protein 1 and APC Anaphase Promoting Complex.Although the ligand for nematode LGC-54 is not yet identified  , the predicted protein contains a tryptophan in ligand-binding loop C amino acid position 231  , which has been hypothesized to be a key residue for binding amines 45  , and it is known that other family members including Cel-lgc-55  , the most closely related paralog in C. elegans are activated by serotonin  , dopamine and tyramine 46–48. The likely C. elegans ortholog  , Cel-lgc-54  , is described as a predicted “ligand unknown” biogenic amine-gated chloride channel 43 and as a GABA-receptor 44 but has not been implicated previously in relation to IVM resistance.It can be presumed that the positional relationship of these key amino acid residues and the sensitive domains is common for the sensors described in Refs. The amino acid residue preceding position 148 and the one following position 145 should be the outermost within the cpFP beta-barrel Figure 1b.While in most organisms chordin and BMP are expressed in mutually exclusive patterns  , in the sea urchin and in cnidarians these genes are co-expressed on the same side of the embryo. O  , oral; Ab  , aboral; D  , dorsal; V  , ventral.Embryos treated with SB431542 fail to express Nodal target genes such as chordin Figure 7Diii and BMP2/4 unpublished data and therefore the endogenous nuclear pSmad1/5/8 staining should be eliminated 14 ,16. To prevent synthesis of Chordin and distinguish the ectopic from the endogenous BMP2/4 signal  , the experiment was performed in the presence of the Alk4/5/7 inhibitor SB431542 added after fertilization.It should be noted that position 301  , a functional important residue of the CRE1/AHK4 CHASE domain  , did not fulfil our criteria  , because some bacterial sequences are conserved in the same or a similar amino acid. At position 305  , the plant subgroup has either a basic amino acid or a proline  , while in the other subgroups the class of amino acids is not conserved.Notably  , Shokat and co-workers 15 have developed a chemical-genetics system to modulate the activity of a protein kinase by mutating an amino acid residue in its ATP-binding pocket the 'gatekeeper' residue  , allowing the resulting kinase - often called an analogue-sensitive as-kinase - to accommodate a bulky ATP analogue. Chemical genetics employs small-molecule modulators of protein and nucleic acid activities to elucidate cellular functions of their targets.Cystatin M is a candidate tumor suppressor that functions as a physiological inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases. Several groups have reported DNA methylation-dependent silencing of CST6 gene in breast cancer cell lines and primary invasive ductal carcinomas  , but the upstream initiators that direct this process have not been elucidated 5 ,6.In contrast  , by examining embryos in which Dpp was ectopically expressed  , Mizutani et al. Limited ability of BMPs to diffuse in the absence of carrier proteins such as Chordin has also been documented in Xenopus
50.Similar to the SCF and ECS complexes  , the BTB-containing substrate recognition proteins bind via their BTB domains to the N-terminal region of Cullin-3 49. The substrate specificity of Cullin-based E3 complexes is generally achieved through a variety of substrate recognition adaptors that may be differentially available in different cell types 41 ,49 ,72.A clear Chk1 consensus has not been established so far due to the limited number of its known substrates  , although approaches using peptide libraries for in vitro kinase assays have suggested a general preference for an arginine residue in the -3 position and a hydrophobic residue at -5 26 ,27. Some protein kinases target a well-defined consensus amino acid sequence  , allowing the prediction of potential substrates.To identify possible AXR1 downstream players  , we scored cullin-deficient lines for meiotic defects. In A. thaliana only four cullins are neddylated: cullin 1  , cullin 3A  , cullin 3B  , and cullin 4 33.Occurrence of Cys and Sec in vertebrate SelP sequences. Hyphens '-' indicate that sequence information was not available for this region  , and empty cells correspond to the situations where an amino acid residue other than Sec or Cys is used.This agrees with previous results 16-18; additionally  , these authors described small cullin-like proteins which did not align along the whole length of the region that I considered in this study and therefore were discarded. For example  , one of the three main groups contain three Arabidopsis thaliana genes known as Cul1  , Cul2 and Cul2-like/Cul2b  , this last one a likely pseudogen  , a second group includes two genes named Cul3a and Cul3b and the third just a single gene  , Cul4.Therefore  , modification of the VPGXG backbone with cell-adhesive sequences has been a major issue in developing ELP-based ECM analogues. However  , ELPs containing a neutral or hydrophobic amino acid residue in the guest position X are limited in their usage for cell growth or tissue regeneration due to their low binding affinity to mammalian cells 5.The function of the potential phospho-null S316F and phospho-mimetic S316D OSM-3 was determined by analyzing their ability to rescue the dye-filling defects Dyf in nphp-4tm925;osm-3yhw66 and osm-3mn357 null backgrounds. To explore this possibility  , an OSM-3S316D::GFP construct was generated that would substitute a phospho-mimetic amino acid for the original serine residue  , S316D.Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test of conditional independence 39 was utilized to ensure there was no three-way interaction with the amino acid residue type. To obtain combined p-values we used Stouffer's z-scores 37 and Fisher's sum of logs of p
38 methods.B  , Top Accessible surface area ASA for individual amino acid residues  , expressed as percentage of the total surface area of each residue. A Overlay of 2D 15N-1H-HSQC NMR spectra of MiSp CT with CS2 added to concentrations of 0 mM magenta  , 50 mM blue  , 100 mM cyan  , and 200 mM black.Cullin proteins are typically modified post-translationally by attachment of the small ubiquitin-like protein  , NEDD8. These include several WD40 domain-containing proteins  , which presumably correspond to Neurospora DCAFs  , plus members of the COP9 signalosome complex.Cystatin M is known to inhibit the activity of cystein proteases which degrade extracellular matrix components. Based on these observations  , one possibility is that cystatin M may be a downstream target of HER4-ER in IBC and be influenced by PR.However  , the expression status of ER in IBCs was significantly associated with cystatin M loss P = 0.01. Cystatin M loss was found in 1 3% of 33 ER-negative DCISs and in 8 10% of 84 ER-positive DCISs  , and this difference was not statistically significant P = 0.44.In addition  , KLHL10 was shown to be exclusively expressed in the cytoplasm of developmentally advanced murine spermatids  , and mice carrying a null klhl10 allele are infertile due to defects during late spermatid maturation 98. A recent report suggest that mammalian KLHL10 and Cullin-3 can interact in vitro and that Cullin-3 is highly expressed during late murine spermatogenesis 77.The sequences of cullin proteins are very diverse  , so general trees containing all the sequences found in the TblastN searches failed to unravel the relationships among the sequences of distant species as an example  , see the NJ tree for the 490 sequences in Additional File 2. NC_004327.1  , which apparently lack the Cullin_Nedd8 domain and  , on the other hand  , the complex Cul7 and Parc proteins  , which are encoded by genes derived from gene fusions  , as we already described before 26 ,27.Every tenth residue is indicated with a dot. The secondary structure elements of the T-ag obd are shown above its amino acid sequence.The amino acid residue preceding position 148 and the one following position 145 should be the outermost within the cpFP beta-barrel Figure 1b. Therefore  , it is likely that in Pericams and GCaMPs the amino acid residues 148 and 145 are in a close proximity to the chromophore  , similarly to the native avGFP PDB ID: 1GFL 15.The following information is provided for each putative T3SS effector: Locus tag  , gene name  , %G+C  , sequence of the putative Hrp box  , amino acid residues in the N-terminus  , and closest protein match. Putative T3SS effector genes were identified in the Q8r1-96  , A506  , SS101 and BG33R genomes based on the presence of possible Hrp boxes and N-termini typical of T3SS-secreted proteins i.e.  , abundance of Ser and polar residues at the N-termini  , only one acidic residue in the first 12 positions  , and an aliphatic amino acid in position 3 or 4.Structural information predicts that the BTB proteins might perform the combined functions of Cullin platform interaction and substrate binding roles of the SKP1 and the F-box subunits respectively of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box SCF E3 ligase 35. However POB1 lacks any identifiable C-terminal domain but contains a highly conserved sequence of ~70 amino acids immediately following the BTB domain called a BACK domain.The authors call this group of cells the BCNE blastula Chordin- and Noggin-expressing center  , based on their previous observation that this center expresses the proteins Chordin and Noggin at the blastula stage. Now Hiroki Kuroda  , Oliver Wessely  , and Edward De Robertis challenge this model by demonstrating that a group of cells in the dorsal region of the prospective ectoderm is fated to become neuronal as early as the blastula stage which precedes gastrulation and that these cells can express their neural character in the absence of any mesodermal influence.Whether this infertility is associated with early recombination 42 or later CO resolution defects 43 is still under debate. Indeed  , two converging studies in mice recently showed that cullin 4 is also required for meiosis also in mammals  , as depletion of Cul4a one of the two mammalian Cul4 genes led to male infertility 42 ,43.At the tail bud stage  , chordin injected embryos develop with an ovoid shape typical of dorsalized embryos. C  , D Embryos injected with the sea urchin chordin mRNA.Therefore  , to the best of our knowledge  , cul3 represents the first tissue-specific Cullin identified in any organism. Cullins were previously thought to be universally expressed.For comparing the length of C-terminal regions of multiple species  , the C-terminus of each protein sequence was defined as the amino acid sequence distal of the last transmembrane residue as predicted by TMHMM 57 ,58. Dotplots were generated using the Dotmatcher program in the EMBOSS package 56.Hyphens '-' indicate that sequence information was not available for this region  , and empty cells correspond to the situations where an amino acid residue other than Sec or Cys is used. Sec residues are shown by the red letter U  , and Cys residues by the letter C. Cys residues encoded by TGT are highlighted in blue and those by TGC in green.BMP9 and BMP10 share the same amino acid residue at this position as one of the SYNS1- associated mutants. A third successive mutation K348L  , located on the periphery of the type II receptor interface  , rendered Bmp9 completely Nog-sensitive relative to the control  , without significantly affecting the prochondrogenic potential of the custom variant in the absence of Nog Figure 4C and 4D.In univariate logistic regression analysis Table 2A  , cystatin M loss occurred at 2.20 times 95% confidence interval CI = 1.19 to 4.06; P = 0.02 higher prevalence in the ER-negative IBCs than in the ER-positive IBCs. These observations suggest that the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4 may be significantly associated with cystatin M loss in IBCs.Based on our detailed dissection of D/V patterning in the sea urchin embryo  , we propose a new model and discuss the evolutionary implications of these findings. Finally  , we report that Chordin may not be required for diffusibility of BMP2/4 and that BMP2/4 signaling induces a positive feedback mechanism in responsive cells by inducing the expression of glypican 5  , a positive regulator of BMP signaling and mobility.Overexpression of chordin mRNA disrupted D/V patterning and caused complete xii  , xiii or partial xiv  , xv radialization. unpublished data.Indeed  , at 24 h these embryos display a strong ventralized phenotype as indicated by the presence of ectopic notochords and radial somites. At the tail bud stage  , chordin injected embryos develop with an ovoid shape typical of dorsalized embryos.The sequences of the chordin  , noggin1  , and follistatin-like2b translation-blocking MOs are reported elsewhere 54. Prior to injection  , MOs were diluted to working concentrations in 1× Danieau's Solution 58 mM NaCl  , 0.7 mM KCl  , 0.4 mM MgSO4  , 0.6 mM CaNO32  , 5 mM Hepes pH 7.1–7.3.Depletion of these BMP antagonists in mutant embryos caused mild to moderate ventralization  , similar to that of WT embryos Figure 2M ,N. To further test whether the endogenous BMP signaling machinery is functional in p18ahub embryos  , including the endogenous BMP ligands  , mutant embryos were injected with translation-blocking morpholinos MOs targeting the secreted BMP antagonists Chordin  , Noggin1  , and Follistatin-like 2b 54.This mutation caused a non-synonymous amino acid change see Additional file 7 from a serine residue with a short hydrophilic side-chain at position 15 of the CP to an isoleucine residue with a large hydrophobic side-chain: a change that would be expected to substantially alter the N-terminal structure of CP relative to that of all other known MSV isolates. The G359T mutation observed in a pair of recombinant MSV viruses see Additional file 7 occurred within the potential nuclear localization signal domain located within the cp of MSV 69  , at a site where purine bases are conserved in all known MSV strains data not shown.The second “x” position of this motif was occupied by a non-polar residue G Glycine in “Ophiocordycipitaceae” and “Nectriaceae” clades where as in “Cordycipitaceae/Clavicipitaceae” clade it was represented by a negatively charged amino acid residue D Aspartate. The first “x” position was occupied by a negatively charged residue E Glutamate in “Ophiocordycipitaceae” clade  , a nonpolar residue P Proline in the “Cordycipitaceae/Clavicipitaceae” clade and by a positively charged residue K Lysine in “Nectriaceae” clade.The chemical nature of the third “x” of this motif varied from negatively charged to non-polar/ polar residue. In “Nectriaceae” the first “x” position was shared by N/K/S polar or positively charged residues and second “x” was E  , a negatively charged amino acid similar to the other two clades.Two other S. paradoxus strains have a 14-residue addition with another 32 new amino acid residues created via frameshift. 2012.We thus isolated a P.lividus cDNA encoding Chordin and examined the expression of this gene during early development of the sea urchin embryo. In other systems  , secreted BMP inhibitors such as Chordin in vertebrates or Sog in Drosophila are key regulators of the activity of BMP signals that sequester BMP ligands and prevent them from binding to and activating their receptors while allowing them to diffuse over long distances 1.Although conservation appears throughout the domain  , two regions of high conservation in the beginning and in the very end of the domain are revealed. Square dots appear above every tenth residue  , and the total numbers of amino acid in each domain appear on the right of every line in the final block.Finally  , a G-to-A point mutation that results in an amino acid change from Alanine to Threonine at residue 665 of the protein was found by sequencing the coding region of tat-2 in qm179 mutants Figure 1B. Thirdly  , transgenic expression of tat-2 rescues the suppression of clk-1 by qm179 Figure 1A.These sequences were selected both to cover all the variation detected in previous analyses of cullin proteins and also to specifically check for all members of potential new families  , most especially in protozoans. The protein sequences corresponding to the most conserved region of twelve cullin proteins were used in TblastN searches to find all members of this family present at the nr  , est  , gss  , htgs or wgs databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.Node support was evaluated with 1 ,000 rapid bootstrap replicates 69. We employed ML inference in RAxML v7.0.4 64 using the GTR substitution model for DNA 65 ,66 along with G-distributed rate heterogeneity 67 ,68 and the Whelan and Goldman WAG amino acid substitution matrix 55 with empirical residue frequencies coupled with G-distributed rate heterogeneity.Additionally  , genomic PCR followed by sequencing analysis revealed that the mds1 mutant contains a deletion in the intron that is flanked by exon 2 and exon 3  , suggesting that this intron contains sequences that are only required for the function of cullin-3 in spermatids Figure 2A and 2C. A lethal P-element insertion in the 5′ untranslated region UTR of the cullin-3 gene  , cul3 which failed to complement the lethality of other gft alleles  , complemented the sterility of the mds alleles  , suggesting that these noncoding sequences are only required for the somatic function of cullin-3 Figure 2A  , Table S1  , and unpublished data.However  , the mechanism by which cystatin M expression is regulated by ER  , PR  , and HER4 awaits further elucidation. In addition  , cystatin M loss occurred more frequently in IBCs with the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4 than without  , suggesting that cystatin M expression may be influenced by synergistic effect of those proteins.We first examined the potential involvement of SkpA  , a Drosophila homologue of Skp1 44  , in ddaC dendrite pruning. The N-terminal region of the Cullin proteins interacts with the adaptor subunit Skp1  , and via it with an F-box protein to recruit protein substrates in proximity to the E2 enzyme  , thereby promoting substrate ubiquitination 31.The highlighting color for each SNP corresponds to the amino acid residue at that position as identified in rows 7–9. 12 onwards The SNP sequence for each of the alleles.We called this version as iYTnC2 and used it further for detailed characterization in vitro and in cultured cells. To avoid potential problems with the Cys155 residue oxidation and its post-translational modifications in mammalian cells  , we replaced the Cys residue present in NTnC indicator with Ser in iYTnC  , an amino acid with similar properties.The expression domain of tbx2/3 was strongly expanded in most 30/40 embryos injected with a morpholino directed against chordin ii  , vi covering the whole circumference of the ectoderm  , while in the remaining embryos it appeared only slightly expanded iii. C In situ hybridization showing tbx2/3 transcripts expressed on the dorsal side in control embryos at mesenchyme blastula i and gastrula v.We employed ML inference in RAxML v7.0.4 64 using the GTR substitution model for DNA 65 ,66 along with G-distributed rate heterogeneity 67 ,68 and the Whelan and Goldman WAG amino acid substitution matrix 55 with empirical residue frequencies coupled with G-distributed rate heterogeneity. All three data types DNA  , protein  , and morphology were accommodated in the Bayesian analysis.The strong and mild phenotypes were observed in multiple experiments  , one phenotype or the other prevailing in a given experiment depending on the batch of embryos. Injection of Mo2 chordin at 0.6 mM produced predominantly the luge-like phenotype iv  , ix.Additionally  , CUL4A plays a role in meiotic recombination and spermatogenesis in mice 42 ,43. Cullin RING Ligase 4 CRL4 is associated with DNA repair in plants and humans; the DDB1-CUL4ADDB2 E3 ligase initiates nucleotide excision repair NER by recognizing damaged chromatin with concomitant ubiquitylation of core histones at the lesion site 39–41.Yet further amino acid residue biases became evident when we analyzed subsets of Chk1 target sequences. Furthermore  , they indicate that  , for Chk1 substrates bearing Arg/Lys at -3  , the preferred consensus sequence can be denoted R/K-R/K-d/e-t-S*/T*-X-r/k-r applying a cut-off of five-fold enrichment  , where phosphorylated residues are indicated by asterisks  , preferred amino acids are in capital letters  , disfavored ones are in lower case and × indicates no preference.Gene score was also unrelated to resting heart rate or physical activity questionnaire  , and thus habitual exercise status. No relationship between baseline gene score and renal function estimated from cystatin C  , r2 < 0.001  , systolic blood pressure mmHg  , r2 = 0.0013  , 2 h glucose concentration following a standard oral glucose tolerance test OGTT; mmol  , r2 = 0.015 or total cholesterol mmol  , r2 = 0.002 was observed.x  , amino acid residue missing because of gaps in genome sequences. Color shading highlights the amino acid residues C  , K  , P and Q  , which are assumed to be important for the function of the protein see main text.Our results suggest that  , of the seven CSN subunits in N. crassa  , six act as a functional core in cullin deneddylation. To the best of our knowledge  , this is the first systematic functional analysis of all of the subunits of a complete CSN complex in filamentous fungi.This is consistent with conservation of a small amino acid residue alanine or glycine at LEP of TIPs. Apparently  , water permeability is restored in the quadruple mutant by the LEP-C189G mutation.In addition  , although the absence of CSN-3 did not affect proper assembly of the CSN complex  , the amount of functional core CSN complex was reduced and subcomplexes such as CSN4/5/6 and CSN4/5/6/7 were formed. Although CSN-3 is dispensable for cullin deneddylation  , it plays an important role in maintaining the stability of FBPs such as FWD-1 in SCF complexes  , as well as the stability of Cullin4-based ubiquitin ligases and the CSN-2 subunit.Referred to as Kir6.2L157E  , the mutant varies from the wild type by the substitution of a single amino acid at residue 157 on one of the polypeptide components. In their efforts to unravel the mysteries and mechanisms behind channel gating  , Harley Kurata  , Colin Nichols  , and colleagues discovered a surprising mutation of the ligand-gated K+ channel Kir6.2  , in this issue of PLoS Biology.Subsequent genome sequencing and genetic analysis of 2 more non allelic suppressor mutants allowed to link suppression to either the rad53-H88Y mutant allele  , causing the replacement of Rad53 amino acid residue His88 by Tyr  , or the tel1-N2021D allele  , resulting in the replacement of Tel1 amino acid residue Asn2021 by Asp. Analysis of genomic DNA by next-generation Illumina sequencing of 5 non allelic suppressor mutants revealed that the DNA damage resistance was due to single base pair substitutions in the genes encoding Sgs1  , Top1  , or the multi-drug resistance proteins Pdr3  , Pdr10 and Sap185 13.The first “x” position varied from a non-polar to polar residue and the second “x” position was occupied by a negatively charged amino acid in both the “Ophiocordycipitaceae” and “Cordycipitaceae/Clavicipitaceae” clades. This motif was highly conserved within the 3 clades; however  , the variable amino acid positions x were conserved in a clade specific manner.Figure 4 shows the result for the set of cullin sequences obtained from bikont species. This possibility will be explored in the next section.We identified peptides corresponding to Neurospora NEDD8 in the band that contained CUL4  , suggesting that Neurospora CUL4 is neddylated. Cullin proteins are typically modified post-translationally by attachment of the small ubiquitin-like protein  , NEDD8.a Schematic of human KAP1; known domains are highlighted in color and labeled with bounding amino acid residue numbers. KAP1 Ser473 phosphorylation upon DNA damage.Treatment from the 16-cell stage with the Nodal receptor inhibitor SB431542 also abolished the expression of Delta2 I and Chordin J in the ectoderm  , but the expression of Ap2-like2 was not modified K  , L. This expression corresponds to an expansion of trunk lateral cell fate A7.6 where Delta2 is expressed at the expense of anterior endoderm A7.5 as previously described 72.Nodal was however not the sole mediator of FGF action  , as its inhibition was not sufficient to convert the b6.5 progeny into epidermis  , marked by Ap2-like2 expression Figure S1. Consistent with this  , FGF-induced ectopic activation of Msxb  , Delta2 and Chordin was suppressed by Lefty overexpression Figure 3M-O.Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases CRLs are the major group of E3s. After recruiting the specific substrate  , the ubiquitin ligase E3 complex bridges the targeted protein and E2-ubiquitin to form a polyubiquitinated protein  , which is subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome 6.F-box proteins confer substrate specificity to SCF Skip1-Cullin-F-box protein E3 ubiquitin ligases 19. Ubiquitin is a small protein of 76 amino acids that is transferred by E3 ubiquitin ligases to proteins to be targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome 18.For NMR structure determination  , we initially expressed a 150-amino-acid-residue-long C-terminal part of A. ventricosus MiSp full-length sequence above. The NMR sample was prepared by adding 8% v/v D2O and 0.02% w/v NaN3 to a 1 mM solution of uniformly 13C/15N-labelled protein in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 with 20 mM NaCl.chordin expression begins at the swimming blastula stage and is strictly restricted to the ventral ectoderm up to the early pluteus stage where it is only maintained in a subdomain of the ciliary band. v is a double in situ hybridization with chordin and GATA1/2/3  , which is expressed in the non-skeletogenic precursors on the ventral side of the vegetal plate  , while iv is a double in situ hybridization with chordin and bmp2/4 probes showing that the two genes are expressed in a highly similar pattern.Most cells in the upper row of DCIS and IBC lesions show strong nuclear reactivity for ER and PR  , strong membrane reactivity for HER2  , and strong cytoplasmic staining for HER4 and cystatin M. Magnification × 400. The positive upper row and negative lower row immunostainings for cystatin M  , ER  , PR  , HER2  , and HER4 are shown in DCISs and IBCs.A recent report suggest that mammalian KLHL10 and Cullin-3 can interact in vitro and that Cullin-3 is highly expressed during late murine spermatogenesis 77. These intriguing anatomical and molecular similarities between spermatid individualization processes in Drosophila and mammals suggest that further studies on the link between the ubiquitin-proteasome system and apoptotic proteins during sperm differentiation in Drosophila may provide new insights into the etiology of some forms of human infertilities.In addition  , we have examined the expression and function of sea urchin Chordin and found it to be necessary to prevent BMP signaling on the ventral side. Third  , we showed that the functions of BMP2/4 and of its putative receptor Alk3/6 are not required for specification of ventral cell fates but are essential for specification of dorsal cell fates.Our accompanying paper 17 shows that each column of the multiple alignment in more than 98% cases belongs to one of the 20 frequency column clusters  , which can be thought to be derived from a single amino acid residue. We convert a column of the protein multiple alignment to a frequency vector and find the nearest cluster as described in our paper 17.The third site  , residue 531  , is not included in this partial structure. A partial Nbs1 structure is available 48  , and two of the amino acid sites targeted by positive selection residues 9 and 185 fall on the protein surface Figure 6A.PRDX6 regulates uPAR  , Ets-1  , MMP-9  , RhoC and TIMP-2 expression To further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the PRDX6-mediated invasion phenotype in vitro  , we focused on the several recognized invasion-associated genes. However  , we did not find any significant differences in MMP-1  , MMP-2  , MMP-7  , TIMP-1  , uPA  , cathepsin D  , maspin  , cystatin C  , VEGF  , bFGF  , P21  , IGF-1  , IGF-1R  , IGF-2  , cyclin A  , cyclin D1  , cyclin E  , E-cadherin  , ps2  , C-jun  , C-fos  , trophinin  , TPM4 and TGF-α expression among the parental  , PRDX6 transfectants  , PRDX6 knockdown and control vector cells data not shown.B Model illustrating hypothetical functions for the proteins in A in the molecular motor or during microneme biogenesis in a gliding ookinete. The amino acid numbers for the regulated sites in each protein are stated next to a letter indicating if the phosphorylated residue is a serine S  , threonine T  , or tyrosine Y.As expected from the genetic analysis  , all mds alleles contained mutations in or near exon 1D and hence affect only the testis-specific isoform: cul3 has a 181-bp deletion that eliminates part of 5′ UTR of cul3 orange brackets in Figure 2A and 2C. To determine the molecular nature of the mds alleles  , we sequenced PCR-amplified genomic fragments of the cullin-3 locus from these mutants.Furthermore  , experimental manipulations in Xenopus indicate that a shuttling mechanism of BMP ligands is responsible for translocation of BMP ligands ventrally through association with Chordin 50. A similar situation is found in vertebrates  , with BMP2/4 and chordin being expressed in mutually exclusive territories in the ventral and dorsal regions.Based on these observations  , one possibility is that cystatin M may be a downstream target of HER4-ER in IBC and be influenced by PR. In addition  , molecules involved in cell adhesion to extracellular matix and cytoskeletal interaction are known to be regulated by induced PR even in the absence of ligand 18 ,19.RS1 was an aromatic amino acid  , either histidine or tyrosine in virtually all protein kinases  , while RS2 was typically also an aromatic residue  , usually phenylalanine. They focused on four in particular  , termed RS1  , RS2  , RS3  , and RS4.However  , based on our results  , we would expect that substrate recognition in the soma is mediated by proteins other than Klhl10. Therefore  , Cullin-3 may also play a role to regulate caspase activity in other non-apoptotic processes 13 ,81.Injection of chordin mRNA causes the opposite effect and eliminates tbx2/3 expression n = 29 at the mesenchyme blastula stage iv. This expansion of tbx2/3 in chordin morpholino injected embryos is still visible at the gastrula stage but is less dramatic since most embryos at this stage show a ventral restriction of tbx2/3 expression vii.However  , the latter explanation seems less likely  , since  , in contrast to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 12 amino acid residues of PhoE  , similar peptides lacking the C-terminal Phe or containing a positively charged residue at the penultimate position did not affect Omp85 channel properties at all. An alternative explanation is that the C-terminal recognition site is not completely inactivated by the deletion of the phenylalanine or the presence of a positive charge at the penultimate position.At a more local level  , the substantial diversification of the Cul4 sequences in some fungi  , especially the saccharomycotina Figure 2  , may also be an indication of them having acquired peculiar functional features. A final consideration is that the discovery of multiple  , highly divergent multiple cullin genes in some protozoans  , and especially species of the Alveolata and Excavata groups Figure 3 suggests that the spectrum of possible CRL complexes in eukaryotes may be much wider than the scientific community has so far established.These results suggest that differential expression of cul3 in the male germline and cul3 in somatic tissues accounts for the distinct phenotypes male sterility versus lethality of the different classes of cullin-3 mutations. Therefore  , cul3 has both the genetic and molecular properties of a cul3 null allele Figure 3B and 3D.Altogether  , their results suggest that the Cullin-3 complex adds ubiquitin tags to caspase inhibitors at the beginning of individualization  , thereby dispatching the inhibitors and giving caspases free rein. Through a series of gene deletion and protein interaction experiments  , the researchers identified two proteins Roc1b and Klhl10 that form a complex with Cullin-3 to promote caspase activation and spermatid individualization in the fruit fly.Structural data indicate that cullins act as backbones that facilitate ubiquitination by correctly positioning both the RING finger-containing protein  , that recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2  , and another protein present in the CRL complex  , the substrate receptor  , which confers substrate specificity. The roles of the cullin protein in this type of complex are quite well understood.The remaining embryos were polarized along the D/V axis but failed to elongate and conserved a round shape ii  , vii. About 80% of the embryos injected with Mo1 chordin at either 1 or 1.5 mM developed with a radialized phenotype with numerous ectopic spicules i  , vi.Two other S. cerevisiae strains have a 7-residue addition with another 11 new amino acid residues created via frameshift. 2014.These results suggest that dBruce is at least one of the substrates for the Cullin-3–based E3-ligase complex. On the other hand  , the BIR domain region of another IAP-like protein  , dBruce  , can bind to the substrate recruitment protein Klhl10 in S2 cells Figure 10B and 10C.Triple-negative indicates IBCs with the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4. For HER2-positive IBCs  , cystatin M loss was found in 8 89% of 9 triple-negative cases and in 33 51% of 65 other subtypes P = 0.04.The complex that includes CUL5 targets and suppresses the anti-viral activity of human apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme APOBEC3G  , which is a crucial inhibitor of HIV-1 61. CUL5 codes for the cullin 5 protein  , which is recruited by HIV-1 viral infectivity factor vif to form a protein complex that functions as an ubiquitin ligase.The activation segment comprises several conserved structural features: the magnesium binding loop  , the activation loop and the P+1 loop  , in which the mutation occurred. An amino acid sequence comparison of C. albicans Ssn3 to sequences from S. cerevisiae  , Cryptococcus neoformans  , Mus musculus and Homo sapiens demonstrated this arginine residue to be conserved from fungi to mammals.The figure corresponds to the NJ tree  , but the MP and ML results were topologically so similar that they are also included here. Phylogenetic trees corresponding to animal cullin sequences.Unexpectedly  , in Nematostella vectensis gastrulae  , the homologs of both genes are expressed asymmetrically along a secondary axis perpendicular to the oral-aboral axis. Recent studies have shown that the dpp and chordin genes are present in the genomes of cnidarians  , which are positioned phylogenetically as an outgroup to the bilaterians.The Cullin proteins  , via their C-terminal regions  , bind to the RING-domain protein Roc1-Rbx1-Hrt1  , which recruits an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 31. We next attempted to identify other components of the Cul1-based SCF E3 ligase complex that are required for ddaC dendrite pruning.The mass spectrum also revealed a partial oxidation of the protein  , most likely in a single methionine residue of rApi g 1 16204.77 Da  , Fig. The experimentally determined molecular mass of rApi g 1 averaged over the charge state distribution was 16188.78 ± 0.02 Da  , which agrees well with the theoretical mass calculated from the full amino acid sequence of Api g 1 16188.48 Da.We crossed plants homozygous for the a1-2 haplotype or the a2 haplotype  , to determine whether their incompatibility reactions fit those expected based on the sequence differences outlined above. Expression of the a2 LaSCRL allele was detected in anthers 2 d before anthesis Figure 8B  , but its translated sequence differs from that of a1-2 by one amino acid residue  , and there is a premature stop codon after amino acid residue 45 Figure 3.To quantify Sec/Cys transitions  , we considered that if at least two outgroup and one sister sequence had the same amino acid Sec or Cys  , but the other sister sequence had the opposite residue  , a Sec/Cys transition could be inferred Figure 5a ,b. All 13 Sec/Cys transitions occurred in the Se transport domain of SelP.The relationships between cystatin M loss and PR loss in DCISs and IBCs were similar to those between cystatin M loss and ER loss  , but HER2 loss was not significantly associated with cystatin M loss in DCISs and IBCs P = 0.73 and P = 0.79  , respectively. Cystatin M loss occurred in 50 68% of 74 ER-negative IBCs and in 49 49% of 101 ER-positive IBCs.Interestingly  , the fls
dt3Tpl zebrafish mutant displays similar dominance and variation as the human allele affecting the same residue. For example  , the I418T mutation in human  , which affects the same amino acid as fls
dt3Tpl I327F  , shows distinct phenotypic variability depending on genetic background 18.In wild type embryos at mesenchyme blastula stage  , the pSmad1/5/8 pattern was highly reproducible and staining was consistently detected in half of the embryo corresponding to the dorsal region. To test if Chordin is required to prevent BMP2/4 signaling on the ventral side  , we monitored the distribution of pSmad1/5/8 in wild type embryos and in embryos injected with morpholino oligonucleotides against the chordin transcript Figure 8B.A similar situation is found in vertebrates  , with BMP2/4 and chordin being expressed in mutually exclusive territories in the ventral and dorsal regions. Both genetic and biochemical studies in Drosophila have provided evidence for this translocation mechanism as a way to concentrate Dpp in a subdomain of a territory in which it is expressed uniformly.To explore this possibility  , we developed a new application of the ecological Simpson’s reciprocal index  , the diversity index  , that allowed us to correlate the composition of LCRs and their native genomes. Moreover  , the relation between the amino acid composition of LCRs and the compositional bias of their background genome can provide clues to the evolution of these regions  , as genomes that have similar compositional biases would be expected to have similar LCR residue preferences under a neutral model of evolution.Given the conserved nature of these proteins  , our findings may have important implications for caspase regulation in other systems. Together  , these results define a novel Cullin-3–dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates effector caspase activation in Drosophila spermatids.Of the ten substrates examined  , three CReP  , ZNF395  , and SUN2 were unstable proteins that were stabilized by MLN4924  , suggesting that their turnover is mediated by βTRCP alone or in combination with other cullin-RING ligases. To determine more universally which substrates were quantitatively targeted for degradation by βTRCP  , we expressed tagged versions of the substrates  , inhibited protein synthesis with cycloheximide  , and followed the turnover of the substrate in the absence or presence of MLN4924 Table 1 and S6 Fig.It therefore follows that specification and patterning of the D/V axis of the sea urchin embryo does not result from the interactions between a BMP expressing ventral centre and a Chordin expressing dorsal centre  , as in vertebrates  , but that the activities of these two centres  , which are both induced by Nodal  , are concentrated within the ventral ectoderm. Furthermore we showed that in this rescue experiment  , the Nodal receptor complex not only specifies ventral cell fates in a cell autonomous manner  , but that it causes the BMP pathway to be activated on the opposite side demonstrating that Nodal does not work as a morphogen but that it induces a long range relay molecule that regulates morphogenesis of the dorsal region.Moreover  , the relation between the amino acid composition of LCRs and the compositional bias of their background genome can provide clues to the evolution of these regions  , as genomes that have similar compositional biases would be expected to have similar LCR residue preferences under a neutral model of evolution. Factors that are generally considered are the type of repetitiveness within LCRs and their residue composition as they play a role in 3D protein structures and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of specific regions within a protein 2  , 32  , 42–46.Qualitative analysis of . D No relationship was found between CST6 methylation by MSP and the cystatin M loss in DCIS P = 0.38 and IBC P = 0.50.We first tested whether the levels of KIX8 and KIX9 proteins could be affected by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. As SAP functions in an SKP1/Cullin/F-box SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to mediate proteasome-dependent degradation of substrate proteins38  , we further investigated whether SAP could influence the stability of KIX8 and KIX9.A missense mutation yb1714 in the conserved glycine residue in the α1β2 loop of RRM1 and four other mutations yb1697  , yb1705  , yb1709 and yb1718 in the region between exon 1 and exon 3 were associated with the Red/GreenUnc phenotype Figure 3B and 3C  , top. Figure 3C shows amino acid sequence alignments of the three RRMs from the CELF family members in C. elegans and human.RING containing proteins can either ubiquitinate substrates independently or function as part of a multi-subunit complex which  , in plants  , includes: SCF Skp1-Cullin1-F-box  , CUL3 Cullin 3-BTB/POZ Bric a brac  , Tramtrack and Broad complex/Pox virus and Zinc finger  , CUL4-DDB1 UV-Damaged DNA-Binding protein 1 and APC Anaphase Promoting Complex. The Arabidopsis genome project identified more than a thousand genes encoding putative E3 ligases and these can be divided into seven classes which can be subdivided into two basic groups  , dependant on the occurrence of either a HECT Homology to E6-AP C-Terminus or RING Really Interesting New Gene/ U-box domain 7.If that was the case  , we supported the usefulness of the method to detect functional domains. For example  , when a residue was involved in inter-protein coevolution we examined whether functionally important sites nearby any of the coevolving amino acid regions less than 8 Å distance from the functionally important region was previously reported.B Northern blot analysis of chordin transcripts during sea urchin development. VWC  , von Willebrand factor type C; CHRD  , Chordin domain.Treatments with low doses 1 μM of the Alk4/5/7 inhibitor SB431542 phenocopy the mild chordin morpholino phenotype v  , x. The strong and mild phenotypes were observed in multiple experiments  , one phenotype or the other prevailing in a given experiment depending on the batch of embryos.Ectopic Chordin expression was stronger in a-line ectoderm  , possibly reflecting the stronger levels detected in a8.26 and a8.28 blastomeres compared to b6.5 progeny in control embryos Figure 3C. Ectopic expression of Chordin was observed throughout the ectoderm Figure 3S  , independently of the FGF induction status of the cells.Its expression peaks at the mesenchyme blastula stage  , then decreases progressively during gastrulation and pluteus stages Figure 7B. Northern blot analysis indicated that chordin is a strictly zygotic message that starts to accumulate in the embryo after hatching.In our screen  , we isolated several cullin-3 alleles with mutations in a testis-specific N-terminal Cullin-3 TeNC domain. Like in spermatid individualization  , the apoptotic machinery is used in a spatially restricted way to destroy only parts of a cell 14 ,51–54.It is therefore unlikely that this mutation was completely neutral. This mutation caused a non-synonymous amino acid change see Additional file 7 from a serine residue with a short hydrophilic side-chain at position 15 of the CP to an isoleucine residue with a large hydrophobic side-chain: a change that would be expected to substantially alter the N-terminal structure of CP relative to that of all other known MSV isolates.The structure reveals an extended selectivity filter  , including a fifth amino acid residue at position LCP in loop C that also may play a role in defining substrate profiles of the entire AQP superfamily. The atomic structure of the water and ammonia permeable AtTIP2;1 provides new insights into the substrate selectivity of AQPs.a Location of amino acid substitutions in the predicted modules. f Docking analysis of R442G-trehalose complex showing the position of trehalose in active cavity and the location of residue Gly442There is some evidence that the somatic isoforms of Cullin-3 may also regulate caspase activity in other tissues. However  , based on our results  , we would expect that substrate recognition in the soma is mediated by proteins other than Klhl10.We obtained protein sequences for all genes from Ensembl Version 36. For comparing the length of C-terminal regions of multiple species  , the C-terminus of each protein sequence was defined as the amino acid sequence distal of the last transmembrane residue as predicted by TMHMM 57 ,58.Comparison of AtTIP2;1 with other AQP structures identifies two spatial groups I and II of the carbonyls from residues at position LEP in loop E as illustrated in Supporting Information S1 Fig; top view in Fig 3C. Our structure led us to re-examine the amino acid residue at position LEP in loop E  , which contributes with its carbonyl to the selectivity region.These results demonstrate that the leucine residue substitution present in the BY parent creates loss of Bul2 function  , leading to higher activity of amino acid permeases on cell membranes  , reduced chronological lifespan  , and increased telomere length. Deletion of BUL2 lengthened telomeres in the RM background  , but had no effect in the BY background Figure 4C.During the past decade Cullins have been implicated in a variety of cellular activities 41. In this complex  , Broad-complex  , Tramtrack and Bric-a-Brac BTB domain-containing proteins mediate binding of the Cullin to the substrate  , whereas the Skp1/F-box heterodimer fulfill this function in the SCF complex 41 ,42 ,49.Glypican 5  , which is expressed in the whole ectoderm at this stage  , may also participate in this initial phase of BMP translocation. Therefore  , BMP2/4-Chordin complexes diffuse or are transported toward the dorsal side resulting in formation of a shallow D/V gradient of BMP2/4 signaling.We constructed GST and GAL4 fusions to forms of σE bearing the single amino acid substitution N100E and used them in pull-down and yeast two-hybrid experiments. We wanted to test whether the CsfB anti-sigma factor discriminated between σE and σK by differentiating an asparagine from an acidic residue at the beginning of region 2.3.Next  , considering cullin 3 activity  , we analysed the CUL3a/3b hypomorphic mutant cul3w cul3a3cul3b1 described for its defects in various aspects of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway and root development 63. We first investigated meiosis of the auxin response defective cul1 mutant alleles—cul1–6
60  , axr6-2/N3818
61  , and axr6-3/eta1
62—and observed perfectly normal meiosis not shown.Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by Western blotting with anti-Myc  , anti-Flag  , anti-Cullin-1  , anti-SkpA  , and anti-Akt. The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc  , anti-Flag  , or anti-Akt overnight at 4°C  , followed by incubation with protein A/G beads Pierce Chemical Co. for 2 h. Protein A/G beads were washed four times with cold PBS.Heterogenous staining  , defined in our study as when the staining pattern was different among cells within the same block  , is often known to be seen in epigenetically silenced genes within advanced tumors. A statistically significant association was not found between cystatin M loss and pathologic stage in IBCs P = 0.86.The deepest dichotomy shown in Figure 5 separates a group formed by several animal cullin genes Cul1  , Cul2  , Cul5  , Cul-Dros  , Cul7/Parc a single fungal cullin gene Cul1  , also known as Cdc53 and two recently duplicated plant cullin genes Cul1 and Cul2 from two other groups which respectively include the cullin genes so far named Cul3 and Cul4 in animals  , plants and fungi. As indicated in that figure  , the results obtained are totally compatible with that possibility.Following their activation at the 64-cell stage in the b7.9/10 blastomeres  , Msxb and Chordin remain expressed in all daughter cells until mid-gastrula stages but Delta2 expression becomes restricted in b8.18/20 blastomeres  , precursors of the dorsal tail midline epidermis Figure 2. While Msxb is essential for the formation of both dorsal tail epidermis midline and dorsal nerve cord 23  , 35  , the role of the two other genes remains to be investigated.However  , no confounding effect of HER2 was found in this study: cystatin M loss occurred at a higher prevalence in the triple-negative IBCs than in other subtypes irrespective of HER2 expression Figure 2B. To rule out the possibility of a confounding effect of HER2 in the relationship between cystatin M loss and the triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4  , we stratified the data according to the expression status of HER2 and reanalyzed the relationship according to HER2.Approximately 2–4 pl of oligonucleotide solution at 0.5 mM for Mo-nodal1  , 0.8–0.6 mM for Mo-alk3/6  , 1–1.5 mM for Mo-1 chordin  , and 0.4–0.6 mM for Mo2-chordin were used in the experiments described here. For each morpholino a dose-response curve was obtained and a concentration at which it did not elicit non-specific defect was chosen.AW performed cloning of human 5-HT3A receptor subunit and APBB1 into pGEMHE vector and made a quintuple mutant 5 consecutive mutations in human 5-HT3A subunit. He also cloned Akt3v1 or Akt3v2 into pLXSN vector and made a multiple mutation 8 amino acid residue substitutions spanning 13 codons and several chimeras.We also identified a BTB-domain protein  , Klhl10  , that selectively binds to the testis-specific form of Cullin-3  , but not to somatic Cullin-3. We show that the small RING domain protein  , Roc1b  , interacts with Cullin-3 in spermatids to promote effector caspase activation.Despite the regulatory complexity of the current model  , it inadequately addresses two issues that are central to our understanding of the circuitry controlling the HSR  , motivating us to search for additional players in the response: 1 Exhaustive genetic screens for mutations in σ32 that result in misregulation have identified a small cluster of four closely spaced amino acid residues Leu47  , Ala50  , Lys51  , and Ile54  , of which three are surface exposed  , as well as a somewhat distant fifth residue that abuts this patch in the folded σ32 structure. Their close connection is indicated because 1 the IM protease  , FtsH  , not only degrades σ32  , but also maintains quality control in the IM by degrading unassembled IM proteins; 2 induction of the HSR is a very early response to perturbations in the co-translational membrane-trafficking system that brings ribosomes translating IM proteins to the membrane 27–29; and 3 IM proteins are significantly overrepresented both in the σ32 regulon 30 and in an unbiased overexpression screen for HSR inducers 30.Injection of Mo2 chordin at 0.6 mM produced predominantly the luge-like phenotype iv  , ix. In some experiments  , however  , injection of the same doses of morpholino produced a milder but very reproducible phenotype characterized by a luge-like shape due to the parallel growth of the body rod spicules  , and the presence of a proboscis in the animal region in place of the oral arms iii  , iv  , viii  , ix.This result is somewhat surprising  , because there have been no previous reports of tissue-specific expression of different Cullin isoforms with distinct biochemical and functional properties. The latter is transcribed from a separate promoter and contains a unique first exon that encodes the N-terminal TeNC domain.Pl-chordin: Degenerated primers were derived from an alignment of the conserved first von Willebrand factor type C of vertebrate Chordin sequences. Pl-alk3/6: Degenerated primers were derived from an alignment of the kinase domain from Activin Like Kinase ALK Type I receptors.These phenotypes abnormal patterning of the ectoderm in the animal hemisphere and parallel growth of the spicules were consistently observed following injection of a second non-overlapping morpholino directed against the 5′ UTR of the chordin transcript Mo2 chordin Figure 8Aiv  , ix. A very peculiar and characteristic skeletal defect was observed in these embryos: the body rods spicules grew parallel instead of forming a triangle in the dorsal region  , giving the embryos a luge-like shape Figure 8Aiii  , viii.Correlation analysis of residue frequencies at single motif positions with amino-acid property scales 20 ,21 can quantify the conservation of a physical property pattern see Materials and methods. The previously reported preferences for aliphatic residues at positions +1 and +2 the aa in CaaX were recovered  , but there is a clear tendency for other residue types to also be allowed  , especially at position +1 the first a in CaaX.A recent study showed that in Cephalochordates  , the most basal chordates according to recent phylogenetic analyses  , the expression domain of chordin and BMP2/4 retained the same orientation as in protostomes i.e.  , BMP2/4 being dorsal and chordin ventral 4  , suggesting that any inversion occurred after the emergence of chordates or  , alternatively  , that a second inversion would have occurred independently in this lineage. According to this hypothesis  , the common ancestor would have possessed a centralized nervous system and a plausible mechanism to explain the D/V axis inversion is that the mouth would have moved from one side of the embryo to the other or  , that the trunk would have rotated 180° relative to the head 6.Interestingly  , the unique N-terminal half of Caldendrin exhibits no similarity to other known proteins 16. Modelling of the C-terminal segment suggests that Caldendrin displays an altered surface-exposed amino acid residue distribution  , especially at EF-hand 2 as compared to CaM 18.These primers were used to amplify partial cDNA fragments for both genes using RT PCR and a cDNA mix from mixed embryonic stages. Pl-chordin: Degenerated primers were derived from an alignment of the conserved first von Willebrand factor type C of vertebrate Chordin sequences.Complete suppression of any of cullin functions null cul1 or cul4 or the double cul3a cul3b mutants is lethal  , but various genetic backgrounds deficient in cullin activities are available To identify possible AXR1 downstream players  , we scored cullin-deficient lines for meiotic defects.Examining the whole collection  , all but one of the sequenced isolates contained the arginine residue at position 56  , the exception being the outgroup isolate RH12000692_7401696 Fig. Comparison with RpsL sequences in the public sequence databases showed that in S. aureus the frequent amino acid residue at position 56 was lysine.The overall high degree of conservation strongly suggests that the overall folds of the RunxRD and CBFβ domains studied here are similar to the folds of the corresponding human domains. The Hydra protein has one amino acid deleted in this region  , whereas the Amphimedon CBFβ domain shows a 2-residue insert the same region.Finally  , reverse-transcriptase RT-PCR as well as sequence analyses of several independent clones from adult testis and somatic cDNA libraries confirmed the presence of two major cullin-3 mRNA isoforms  , cul3 and cul3 Figure 2A and 2B; see Materials and Methods for details about the cDNA clones. Additionally  , genomic PCR followed by sequencing analysis revealed that the mds1 mutant contains a deletion in the intron that is flanked by exon 2 and exon 3  , suggesting that this intron contains sequences that are only required for the function of cullin-3 in spermatids Figure 2A and 2C.The His-171-Cys substitution is located in the GEF domain  , where a His residue is conserved among mammalian species Fig 6A. Since the Kozak consensus sequence is present at the second Met of the 17th amino acid residue S4 Fig  , the FGD3 variant probably produces an N-terminal 16 amino acid-truncated protein.the somatic mutation of gene  , a mutation in a particular amino acid residue such as the V600E mutations in the BRAF gene that are common in colorectal and other cancers 56  , or an epigenetic change such as hypermethylation of a promoter. An alteration can be a variety of different genomic  , transcriptomic  , or epigenomic changes measured in a cancer sample; e.g.Furthermore  , exogenous expression of recombinant cystatin M results in the suppression of cell proliferation  , migration  , and matrix invasion in vitro 8. The loss of cystatin M expression is associated with the progression of primary tumors to a metastatic phenotype 3 ,4 ,7.Identity and E-values obtained by stand-alone blastx search against the 25 BmRTEs. Amino acid residue mismatches are indicated in blue  , microsatellite DNA SSR units are underlined.Its expression increases at the mesenchyme blastula stage  , then decreases progressively during gastrulation up to the pluteus stage. chordin is zygotically expressed starting at the swimming blastula stage.Perhaps surprisingly given its partially basic character  , His was not over-represented in the region amino-terminal to the phosphorylation site and was  , in fact  , strongly disfavored at position -5. Notably  , in addition to our data indicating positive amino acid residue selections within the Chk1 motif  , clear amino acid under-representations were also evident at certain positions Figure 2f.Limited ability of BMPs to diffuse in the absence of carrier proteins such as Chordin has also been documented in Xenopus
50. The restricted diffusion of BMP ligands in the absence of carrier proteins such as Sog/Chordin has been proposed to be a key parameter and a condition for robustness in one of the mathematical models proposed to explain formation of the Dpp gradient.A final consideration is that the discovery of multiple  , highly divergent multiple cullin genes in some protozoans  , and especially species of the Alveolata and Excavata groups Figure 3 suggests that the spectrum of possible CRL complexes in eukaryotes may be much wider than the scientific community has so far established. Finally  , it is also interesting to point out that APC2 genes  , not considered here given its low degree of similarity  , may all derive from a fourth gene with a cullin domain that also emerged before the unikont/bikont split 57-60.YOR141C ARP8 encodes an actin-related protein involved in chromatin remodeling in the nucleus. Two other S. paradoxus strains have a 14-residue addition with another 32 new amino acid residues created via frameshift.The USP gene expression data allowed us to associate the transcriptional activity with modifications at residues that are critical for ligand interaction. The residue G130 was the most exchangeable amino acid  , and could thus be most easily substituted non-synonymously Additional file 3: Figure S3C.Based on these reports  , we hypothesized that cystatin M may be a downstream target of ER and/or HER4 and that CST6 methylation may be influenced by the alteration of ER and/or HER4. 14 reported that ER and HER4 can target estrogen-inducible gene promoters such as stromal cell-derived factor 1 SDF-1  , a putative key player of the matrix remodeling.2000  , in view of the impressive effects seen with Chordin and other BMP pathway antagonists  , the relevance of FGF in neural specification in amphibians and fish was slow to be recognized. 1999; Hardcastle et al.Each member of the SCF family of E3 ligases contains the cullin Cdc53  , Skp1  , and the Ring finger subunit Rbx1  , in addition to any one of several substrate adaptors called F-box proteins 21. We next wanted to know which E3 ligase targeted Ndd1 for degradation.Loss-of-function mutations in either a testis-specific isoform of cullin-3  , the small RING protein Roc1b  , or the BTB-Kelch protein Klhl10  , all reduce or eliminate effector caspase activation in spermatids  , are defective in spermatid individualization  , and are male-sterile. In this system  , canonical apoptotic proteins are used to dramatically remodel cell structure by eliminating many organelles and the majority of cytoplasm 12 ,50.Strikingly  , the position homologous to N100 in σK is occupied by an aspartate E93 in B. subtilis and invariably with the exception of the σE proteins by an acidic residue in all other Bacillus sigma factors Fig. An inspection of the amino acid sequence of σE in regions 2.2 and 2.3 revealed an asparagine residue located at position 100 i.e.  , at the beginning of region 2.3 and conserved among all of Bacillus σE orthologues.Expression of Delta2 and Chordin in other territories such as lateral A-line neural precursors was also dependent on Nodal as previously reported 29  , 35  , 73. Treatment from the 16-cell stage with the Nodal receptor inhibitor SB431542 also abolished the expression of Delta2 I and Chordin J in the ectoderm  , but the expression of Ap2-like2 was not modified K  , L.In addition  , epigenetic silencing of the lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin 6 CST6 is more frequently observed in metastatic lesions than in primary cancers 35 and the epigenetic silencing of the chemokine CXCL12 rather than its receptor CXCR4 contributes to the metastatic potential of mammary carcinoma cells 36. Promoter methylation has also been observed in a wide variety of essential molecular pathways in the context of metastatic breast cancer  , including genes involved in apoptosis 26  , DNA repair 27 ,28  , the regulation and composition of the extracellular matrix 29 ,30  , transcription 31 ,32 and the cell cycle 33 ,34.The sea urchin Chordin protein is a strong BMP antagonist when overexpressed in zebrafish. This phenotype is identical to the swirl mutant phenotype that results from disruption of the bmp2b gene 44.For example  , deletion of a single codon can alter protein degradation  , subcellular localization  , DNA binding affinity  , or other protein properties 38 ,39; can cause diseases including cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease 40 ,41; and can even rescue a disease-related phenotype 42. However  , insertion/deletion of a single amino acid residue can have a profound impact on protein function.When these residues are mutated  , cells have both increased level and activity of σ32  , indicating that this region is involved in a central process required for operation of the negative feedback loops that control both the activity and degradation of σ32 Figure 1A 23–25. Despite the regulatory complexity of the current model  , it inadequately addresses two issues that are central to our understanding of the circuitry controlling the HSR  , motivating us to search for additional players in the response: 1 Exhaustive genetic screens for mutations in σ32 that result in misregulation have identified a small cluster of four closely spaced amino acid residues Leu47  , Ala50  , Lys51  , and Ile54  , of which three are surface exposed  , as well as a somewhat distant fifth residue that abuts this patch in the folded σ32 structure.We noticed transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic or amphipathic to hydrophobic residue is more frequently substituted in the buried regions of AD proteins compared to ID and IG proteins. The average amino acid exchange frequencies among hydrophobic  , hydrophilic and amphipathic amino acids among AD  , ID  , IG genes for buried regions of proteins are diagrammatically represented in Figure 2.Decreased activity of the nucleotide excision repair NER pathway in cells with prolonged p21WAF1/Cip1 expression.

Chordin  , which is normally expressed in the progeny of b6.5 as well as in a8.26 and a8.28 blastomere pairs Figure 3C  , was expressed throughout the posterior ectoderm and in part of the anterior ectoderm in response to ectopic FGF treatment Figures 3C and 3G.The critical role of proteasomal degradation in Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation was also evident from the inhibition of T-DNA expression by a proteasomal inhibitor. It was shown recently that VirE2 is specifically targeted for degradation by the VirF-containing Skp1-Cdc53-cullin-F-box complex for proteolysis 28.In eukaryotic systems  , CRLs play essential roles in many processes  , including cell division  , cell proliferation  , cell differentiation  , and circadian clock function 12. A typical CRL complex consists of a cullin subunit Cul1  , Cul3  , or Cul4  , a RING protein Hrt1/Roc1/Rbx1  , an adaptor protein Skp1 in SCF complexes  , DDB1 in Cul4-based E3  , and a substrate-recognition subunit such as F-box proteins FBPs in SCF complexes 7  , BTB proteins in Cul3-type E3 complexes 8  , and DCAFs in Cul4-DDB1 E3 complexes 9–11.The SCF Skp1-Cullin-1-F-box complexes are  , so far  , the best-characterized Cullin-dependent E3 ligases. The human genome encodes seven different Cullins: Cullin-1  , −2  , −3  , −4A  , −4B  , −5  , and −7 41 ,42.As a control  , we used a morpholino directed against the hatching enzyme gene: 5′-GCAATATCAAGCCAGAATTCGCCAT-3′. Injection of Mo1 chordin morpholino caused absolutely no toxicity even when high doses up to 2 mM were used while the Mo2 chordin started to cause non-specific defects when injected at concentrations above 0.8 mM.Unlike skr-1/2  , none of the other skr clones or cul-1 had a significant effect on Pgst-4::GFP induction after juglone exposure S7B Fig. To address whether other skr genes or components of the SCF complex are also required for gst-4 activation in response to juglone  , we performed an RNAi screen against a sub-library of available skr dsRNA clones skr-3  , 5  , 7  , 8  , 9  , 10  , 11  , 12  , 13  , 15  , 17  , 18  , 19  , 20  , and 21 and cul-1  , which is the only cullin that is known to interact with SKR-1 and 2 23 ,24.While control embryos showed a restricted dorsal nuclearization of pSmad1/5/8 i  , embryos injected with the Mo1 chordin morpholino showed a broad expansion of the nuclear staining to the whole circumference of the ectoderm ii. B pSmad1/5/8 immunostaining of mesenchyme blastula stage embryos.If the mean score was less than two  , the tumor was considered to exhibit loss of cystatin M expression. We then calculated the mean IS in all groups.A lethal P-element insertion in the 5′ untranslated region UTR of the cullin-3 gene  , cul3 which failed to complement the lethality of other gft alleles  , complemented the sterility of the mds alleles  , suggesting that these noncoding sequences are only required for the somatic function of cullin-3 Figure 2A  , Table S1  , and unpublished data. Our genetic and molecular analyses identified a new exon  , 1D  , and suggested that the cullin-3 gene codes for two major isoforms that are somatic and testis specific Figure 2A and 2B.Notably  , both mouse Klhl10  , which shares 46% identity with its Drosophila counterpart and mouse Spop as well as Drosophila Spop were previously shown to interact with Cullin-3 44 ,75–78. Several cDNA clones  , which encode for Drosophila orthologues of three BTB domain–containing proteins  , Spop CG9924  , Ipp CG9426  , and Klhl10 CG12423  , were isolated in this screen Figure 6.Previously  , the assignment of CaaX box substrate proteins to either FT or GGT1 has been based mainly on the identity of the final residue in the motif position +3 where FT allows several amino-acid types and GGT1 clearly prefers leucine 13 ,27. Similarily  , substrate proteins ending with phenylalanine  , such as the CVIF of R-Ras2/TC21  , are not specific to either enzyme and can be substrates to FT and GGT1 31.Cullin RING Ligase 4 CRL4 is associated with DNA repair in plants and humans; the DDB1-CUL4ADDB2 E3 ligase initiates nucleotide excision repair NER by recognizing damaged chromatin with concomitant ubiquitylation of core histones at the lesion site 39–41. Inactivation of cul4a affected male fertility  , with increased death of pachytene/diplotene cells and defects in MLH1 dissociation from the SCs.cul3 contains a five-nucleotide deletion that results in a premature stop codon at amino acid 748 that removes half of the C-terminal Cullin homology domain CHD. cul3 is missing a single nucleotide causing a premature stop codon at amino acid 167. cul3 bears a C-to-T transversion  , which results in an A710-to-V conversion.This change in expression correlates with and may be involved in the fate restriction that occurs at early gastrula stages. Following their activation at the 64-cell stage in the b7.9/10 blastomeres  , Msxb and Chordin remain expressed in all daughter cells until mid-gastrula stages but Delta2 expression becomes restricted in b8.18/20 blastomeres  , precursors of the dorsal tail midline epidermis Figure 2.These observations suggest that the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4 may be significantly associated with cystatin M loss in IBCs. Cystatin M loss occurred at a 3.57 times 95% CI = 1.28 to 9.98; P = 0.01 higher prevalence in the triple-negative IBCs than in other subtypes  , after adjusting age.In contrast  , the full-length ABCC2 protein of 1339 amino acids predicted from the YFO or H. subflexa sequence 97% amino acid identity has all the features of the bipartite structure of ABC transporters  , with six transmembrane segments and a large cytoplasmic ATP-binding domain in each half 29 Figure 4  , Figure 5. The frameshift generated by this deletion predicts a truncated 99-residue protein from YHD3 mRNA.Our genetic analyses suggested the existence of two functionally distinct isoforms of cullin-3  , cul3 and cul3. These results suggest that differential expression of cul3 in the male germline and cul3 in somatic tissues accounts for the distinct phenotypes male sterility versus lethality of the different classes of cullin-3 mutations.A G164A mutation in the mp of one MSV-MatA derived virus and one MSV-VW-derived virus occurred at a site encoding a residue within the hydrophobic potential trans-membrane domain of MP 70. This mutation would have resulted in a relatively conservative amino acid change from a hydrophobic valine residue to a hydrophobic isoleucine residue and it is therefore possible that the mutation was selectively neutral.Fruit flies and mammals share many aspects of spermatid individualization  , and human fertility requires the Cullin-3 enzyme complex. In addition to identifying a new E3 ligase in the regulation of caspases  , these results may also shed light on the origins of human infertility.The mds1 mutants were crossed to all the deficiency lines from FlyBase's second chromosome “kit” and the trans-heterozygotes were tested for male fertility. See details in the main text on the final mapping of the mds1 to cullin-3.A second  , albeit less parsimonious option  , is that saccharomycotina species have lost their ancestral cul4-like gene and in parallel an additional cullin gene arose by duplication  , giving rise to the CUL8/RTT101 gene. One option is that CUL8/RTT101 genes in saccharomycotina are indeed cul4-like genes that have suffered an acceleration of their evolutionary rates which makes difficult to determine their precise phylogenetic position.The predicted transmembrane domain is highlighted with a blue box to delimit the extracellular domain versus the intracellular domain. Note that the available aa sequence of a1-2 is identical to that of a2 except for one amino acid residue located in the intracellular kinase domain.Furthermore  , a gene encoding a putative dopamine receptor  , Hco-ggr-3  , has been implicated in IVM resistance in H. contortus 48. Although the ligand for nematode LGC-54 is not yet identified  , the predicted protein contains a tryptophan in ligand-binding loop C amino acid position 231  , which has been hypothesized to be a key residue for binding amines 45  , and it is known that other family members including Cel-lgc-55  , the most closely related paralog in C. elegans are activated by serotonin  , dopamine and tyramine 46–48.This modified ATP-binding pocket allows the specific inhibition of the as-kinase in vivo by using specific cell-membrane-permeable  , non-hydrolysable ATP analogues. Notably  , Shokat and co-workers 15 have developed a chemical-genetics system to modulate the activity of a protein kinase by mutating an amino acid residue in its ATP-binding pocket the 'gatekeeper' residue  , allowing the resulting kinase - often called an analogue-sensitive as-kinase - to accommodate a bulky ATP analogue.The age of patients with DCIS or IBC was not significantly different according to cystatin M expression P = 0.13 and P = 0.89  , respectively. Cystatin M loss was found in 9 8% of the 117 DCISs and in 99 56% of 175 IBCs studied P < 0.0001.In this complex  , Broad-complex  , Tramtrack and Bric-a-Brac BTB domain-containing proteins mediate binding of the Cullin to the substrate  , whereas the Skp1/F-box heterodimer fulfill this function in the SCF complex 41 ,42 ,49. More recently  , the molecular composition and function of the Cullin-3–dependent E3 ligase complex has also been described 43–48.To date  , no IHC studies using specific antibodies raised against small isovariants of a single haptenic molecule  , for instance  , the free α-carboxylic acid or the structural α-amidated isoform of an amino acid residue ≤200 kDa have been studied or reported. In general  , antibodies generated to characterize the anatomical distribution of valine-amide peptide immunoreactivity in the brain or neuroendocrine tissues required the synthesis of a fragment or peptide motif encoded along the complete amino acid sequence of the peptide of interest  , and used then  , as the antigenic epitope to which the antibody is targeted 39.The co-expression of BMP2/4 and chordin in the ventral ectoderm of the sea urchin embryo contrasts with the situation present in embryos of all the other bilaterians organisms Figure 12. One novel finding of this study is that BMP2/4 and chordin are co-expressed in the ventral ectoderm of the embryo.The Primers used to amplify chordin were: Chordin F1  , 5′-TGYACNTTYGGNGCNGAYTTYTA-3′  , which is derived from the peptide sequence CTFGADFY; Chordin R1  , 5′-GGRCANGTYTTRCARCARAANCC-3′  , which is derived from the peptide sequence GFCCKTCP. The Primers used to amplify alk3/6 were as follows: Alk3/6 F1  , 5′-GCNTTYATHGCNGCNGAYATHCC-3′  , which is derived from the peptide sequence AFIAADIP; Alk3/6 R1  , 5′-CATRTCNGCDATCATRCANGTNCC-3′  , which is derived from the peptide sequence GTCMIADM.AtTIP2;1 groups together with aquaglyceroporins and the water-permeable human AQP4 group I  , whereas the majority of water-specific AQPs constitutes group II due to an asparagine at position LCP in loop C Fig 3D  , which can form a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of the amino acid residue at position LEP. Comparison of AtTIP2;1 with other AQP structures identifies two spatial groups I and II of the carbonyls from residues at position LEP in loop E as illustrated in Supporting Information S1 Fig; top view in Fig 3C.Protein  , domain  , and linker lengths appear to vary among OIE proteomes; but what is unclear is whether an amino acid length difference of only one or two residues would impact the function  , and therefore evolution  , of the protein. These few examples provide some evidence that relatively few residue changes can significantly alter protein function.Several groups have reported DNA methylation-dependent silencing of CST6 gene in breast cancer cell lines and primary invasive ductal carcinomas  , but the upstream initiators that direct this process have not been elucidated 5 ,6. The CST6 gene encoding cystatin M contains a large CpG island that spans the proximal promoter and exon 1  , encompassing the transcription start site.Triple-negative breast cancers TNBCs of ER  , PR  , and HER2  , are known to be typically associated with poor prognosis due to aggressive behavior of the tumor and lack of targeted therapies. However  , no confounding effect of HER2 was found in this study: cystatin M loss occurred at a higher prevalence in the triple-negative IBCs than in other subtypes irrespective of HER2 expression Figure 2B.In protein structure level  , the higher residue burial is observed in two types of disease genes compared to non-disease genes and the propensity of single nucleotide polymorphisms to substitute hydrophilic  , amphipathic amino acid by hydrophobic amino acid in disease groups could be prompted as a reason of lower sequence divergence in autoimmune disease and other immunological disease genes than immunological genes. Moreover  , it is also observed in our search that autoimmune disease and other immunological disease genes are more prone to post-translational phosphorylation which may regarded as a possible reason for slower evolutionary rate.It was shown recently that VirE2 is specifically targeted for degradation by the VirF-containing Skp1-Cdc53-cullin-F-box complex for proteolysis 28. Indeed the very tight interaction between VirE2 and the ssDNA and between VirE2 molecules seem to need a specific mechanism of degradation to remove the VirE2 protein.However  , although the 117 known amino acid long transcript is annotated in chimpanzee and orangutan  , this transcript is missing in gorilla genome annotation. DSCR4 is an experimentally known gene  , present in Ensembl  , VEGA and consensus CDS protein set CCDS databases  , and codes one known 117 amino-acid residue long polypeptide  , one putative 127 amino-acid residue long polypeptide and a single 79 nonsense mediated decay transcript.This expansion of tbx2/3 in chordin morpholino injected embryos is still visible at the gastrula stage but is less dramatic since most embryos at this stage show a ventral restriction of tbx2/3 expression vii. The expression domain of tbx2/3 was strongly expanded in most 30/40 embryos injected with a morpholino directed against chordin ii  , vi covering the whole circumference of the ectoderm  , while in the remaining embryos it appeared only slightly expanded iii.Relationship between cystatin M loss and the triple-negative status of ER  , PR  , and HER4. Triple-negative indicates IBCs with the losses of ER  , PR  , and HER4.RS3 and RS4 were almost always hydrophobic. RS1 was an aromatic amino acid  , either histidine or tyrosine in virtually all protein kinases  , while RS2 was typically also an aromatic residue  , usually phenylalanine.The deduced amino acid sequences are indicated above each nucleotide sequence  , and the deduced amino acid change S194 to N194 is shown in bold. The G nucleotide residue mutated to an A nucleotide in the scs9 allele is indicated in bold letters.The most parsimonious conclusion is that each type of cullin was already involved in a different type of complex. We may deduce in which type of complexes the three different ancestral cullins were involved  , by considering what is currently known in model species Table 1.For each experiment about 150–200 eggs were injected for morphological observations  , and 200–300 for in situ hybridization. Approximately 2–4 pl of oligonucleotide solution at 0.5 mM for Mo-nodal1  , 0.8–0.6 mM for Mo-alk3/6  , 1–1.5 mM for Mo-1 chordin  , and 0.4–0.6 mM for Mo2-chordin were used in the experiments described here.Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalX 2.07 19 and manually corrected using GeneDoc 20. Domains in cullin proteins were characterized using InterProScan 25.B The Chordin/BMP2/4 complexes produced on the ventral side of the embryo can nevertheless diffuse towards the dorsal side of the embryo where Tolloid/BMP1 releases free BMP2/4 ligands that  , in the absence of Chordin  , can bind to their receptors and trigger Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and nuclearization. Therefore  , on the ventral side of the embryo  , no free BMP2/4 ligand can bind to BMP receptors since an excess of Chordin is able to constantly reform Chordin/BMP2/4 complexes.Ectopic expression of Chordin was observed throughout the ectoderm Figure 3S  , independently of the FGF induction status of the cells. We next overexpressed Nodal throughout the ectoderm using the pFOG driver and analyzed marker expression in the a- and b-line ectoderm.contains a NJ-based phylogenetic tree for the whole dataset 490 sequences. NJ tree for all cullin sequences.Detection of immunoreactivity by each antibody was performed by the Vectastain Elite ABC reagent Vector Laboratories  , Burlingame  , CA  , USA and 3.3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was used as a chromogen. Sections were incubated with a primary antibody overnight at room temperature after blocking nonspecific proteins with 2% dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline PBS for 30 minutes and 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 h. The antibodies used were ER clone 6F11  , Novocastra  , Vision Systems Inc.  , Norwell  , MA  , USA  , diluted at 1:400  , PR clone 16  , Novocastra  , diluted at 1:800  , C-erb2 clone CB11  , Novocastra  , diluted at 1:400  , C-erb4 clone HFR-1  , Neomarkers  , Fremont  , CA  , USA  , diluted at 1:30  , and cystatin M clone 211515  , R&D Systems  , Minneapolis  , MN  , USA  , diluted at 1:20.Genes encoding lysosomal enzymes  , such as cathepsins S  , Z  , and D were each increased several-fold. The expression of cystatin F  , α2-macroglobulin  , and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP were also markedly increased.Given our previous results implicating the TeNC domain in Cul3Testis function  , we asked whether any of these proteins bind preferentially to this domain. Notably  , both mouse Klhl10  , which shares 46% identity with its Drosophila counterpart and mouse Spop as well as Drosophila Spop were previously shown to interact with Cullin-3 44 ,75–78.A final  , logical conclusion of the results presented here is that to generate a revised cullin nomenclature based on evolutionary relationships would be advisable. In fact  , previous analyses had failed to properly situate the plant Cul1/Cul2 branch 17 ,18  , which I have shown here to clearly correspond to the Culα plant sequences Figure 4.Following this role in establishing the primary ectodermal domains  , BMPs and their antagonists  , such as Short gastrulation Sog/Chordin Chd  , interact in a graded fashion to establish a series of nested gene expression domains in the non-neural ectoderm. Bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs are one of the best studied examples of morphogens and function in a conserved fashion to subdivide the early embryonic ectoderm into neural versus non-neural regions 3.Cullins contain a C-terminal cullin homology domain CHD that can bind small RING domain proteins  , which in turn recruit a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 to generate the catalytic module 42 ,49 ,72. These results support the idea that Roc1b is a functionally relevant partner of Cullin-3 in vivo.This increase in the hydrophobicity lead to higher thermo-stability of 1-D5 than WT. The mutation R116W changed the polar amino acid residue to hydrophobic residues while the mutations A43V and D147N tend to increase the hydrophobicity of EstS 34.These proteins possess unique catalytic triad  , Ser-Glu-Asp as well as the presence of an aspartic acid residue in the oxyanion hole. The protein folds of S53.001 peptidases resembles that of Subtilisin S08.005  , however they are considerably larger  , with the mature catalytic domains containing approximately 375 amino acids.In four of the five neoteleost S100B proteins a common three amino acid deletion has removed a key residue of the S100-specific calcium-binding loop. In other words  , this particular deletion may be considered a local optimum in the state space of S100 sequences  , consistent with a particular function for these genes.To determine if the dorsalization of p18ahub embryos results from impaired BMP signaling  , we examined BMP ligand gene expression  , as well as expression of the BMP antagonist chordin chd in mutant embryos. chd expression  , which is restricted to the dorsal side of the early zebrafish gastrula 53  , is circumferentially expanded in mutant embryos at an early gastrula stage Figure 2G ,H  , consistent with reduced BMP signaling and excessive dorsal fate specification in p18ahub embryos.Secondly  , mutations in any of the three cullin-3 complex genes retain AXO 49 staining  , which has a temporal pattern of expression virtually identical with CM1-staining. This confirms our earlier result that caspase activation in this system is independent of general differentiation events 12.We found that BMP2/4 is highly diffusible in these conditions. In this study  , we examined the range of BMP2/4 signaling in embryos treated with the Nodal receptor inhibitor SB431542 that prevents chordin expression.This model is further supported by the findings that the Cullin-3–based complex and effector caspases are activated in a very similar spatiotemporal pattern in individualizing spermatids  , which is consistent with a direct link between effector caspase activation and protein ubiquitination in this system. A simple working model to explain our results is that the Cul3-Roc1b-Klhl10 complex promotes caspase activation via ubiquitination and degradation of a caspase inhibitor Figure 9.Each dataset was preprocessed by removing all phosphopeptides with ambiguous sites phosphogroups that could not be attributed to a specific amino acid residue  , by removing peptides that could not be retraced unambiguously to one specific protein  , and by applying a strict threshold on the peptide identification scores. We used criteria for filtering the input data that in many cases are more stringent than the criteria used in the original publications.This hypothesis is supported by the independent results in the different groups on which I have focused this study mainly animals  , fungi and plants; Figures 1  , 2  , 3 and 4  , and especially by the combined results when all the sequences in animals and plants and a selected group of slowly evolving sequences from fungi are analyzed together Figure 5 and fit well with the available functional data Table 1. The results obtained are compatible with the presence of three cullin genes which I have named Culα  , Culβ and Culγ in early eukaryotic evolution.An arrowhead indicates the amino acid residue substituted in the Yellow mutant allele unc-75 yb1698. The amino acid positions are indicated.The MetL775R substitution in donut mutants represents a significant shift in amino acid charge and polarity at a residue that is conserved in vertebrates as a leucine or an isoleucine Fig. 1H.The number of genes encoding BTB domain containing proteins is very large  , with an estimated 140–250 proteins in Drosophila 42 ,49. Cullin-3–dependent E3 ligases use BTB domain containing proteins for substrate recognition 44 ,45 ,49.Amino acid alignment of the ATP-binding region of Chk1 with those of protein kinases for which as versions have been already successfully generated suggested that Leu84 should behave as the gatekeeper residue Figure 1a. Collectively  , these data suggested that Chk1 autophosphorylation in vitro can mimic ATR activation of Chk1  , and more importantly  , revealed that Chk1-L84G serves as an active as version of Chk1.However  , ELPs containing a neutral or hydrophobic amino acid residue in the guest position X are limited in their usage for cell growth or tissue regeneration due to their low binding affinity to mammalian cells 5. Both biological and mechanical properties of ELPs can be readily tailored at the gene level to satisfy end-user applications  , thus offering numerous choices for the development of cell culture matrices for tissue engineering 4.MutationFinder 92  , a rule-based system  , can extract amino acid mutation mentions from large text collections. Recent text-mining applications have tackled the extraction of specific biological attributes of genes or proteins  , such as their sequences  , polymorphisms and mutations  , residue modifications for example  , phosphorylation  , or even their subcellular locations.Cullin-mediated turnover of CReP in response to DNA damage was not restricted to HEK293 cells  , since it occurs in both primary human fibroblasts Fig 5D and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs S12 Fig. The residual CReP turnover seen even in cells treated with βTRCP shRNA may reflect our inability to achieve sufficient knockdown of βTRCP  , or additional turnover mediated by another CRL.Structural similarity between CgE and host FcγRs was suggested based on a 38-residue region of sequence similarity 46% amino acid identity between human FcγRII residues 109–154 and gE residues 322–359 and the spacing between gE residues Cys323 and Cys359  , which is similar to the typical spacing between cysteines in the disulfide bond linking strands B and F in Ig folds 
14. Other IgG receptors of known structure  , which include the mammalian FcγR proteins found on the surface of immune cells  , also belong to the Ig superfamily reviewed in 
30.Functional analysis of the cnidarian chordin and dpp genes and investigation of the role of the BMP chordin signaling network in additional protostomes organisms are required to address these issues. Another hypothesis is that in the two radially symmetrical organisms  , the sea urchin and the sea anemone  , BMP signaling may have evolved independently on the basis of co-expression.bmp2b expression appeared normal in late blastula stage mutant embryos data not shown. To determine if the dorsalization of p18ahub embryos results from impaired BMP signaling  , we examined BMP ligand gene expression  , as well as expression of the BMP antagonist chordin chd in mutant embryos.In this case  , AC and AO are the Cβ–Cβ distances separating pairs of equivalent residues in adjacent subunits in ELIC and GLIC  , respectively  , whereas NC and NO are the distances separating pairs of equivalent residues in nonadjacent subunits in ELIC and GLIC  , respectively. The formulas are also used to calculate the displacement of a residue in GLIC relative to the structurally aligned amino acid in ELIC using the crystal structures.As shown in that table  , genes included in the Culα group in Figure 4 encode proteins that are very often part of F-box CRLs 28-34  , while Culβ genes in general encode cullins that interact with BTB domain-containing proteins 35-40 and the products of Culγ genes are included in DDB CRL complexes 41-50. Table 1 shows the functional data that also support the early emergence of three cullin genes.In addition of the intrinsic importance of cullins as critical players in ubiquitination control  , they have recently received additional attention due to implication of mutations in cullin-encoding genes in several human diseases 10-13. 5 ,6.Black arrowheads indicate b-line neural precursors. Expression of Delta2 and Chordin in other territories such as lateral A-line neural precursors was also dependent on Nodal as previously reported 29  , 35  , 73.In the Nectriaceae clade  , the first two “xx” were occupied by GT Glycine-Threonine or AS Alanine-Serine residues  , in which the first was a non-polar and second was a polar amino acid residue. In the “Cordycipitaceae/Clavicipitaceae” clade  , the first two “xx” were represented by DQ Aspartate- Glutamine  , RA Arginine- Alanine  , GR Glycine-Arginine  , AR Alanine-Arginine  , SR Serine-Arginine and DR Aspartate-Arginine  , in which the first residue varied from negatively charged to a non-polar/polar residue; the second residue which was an almost conserved R Arginine  , was replaced by Q Glutamine in only one member; the third “x” changed from non-polar residue V Valine to another non-polar residue I Isoleucine.About 80% of the embryos injected with Mo1 chordin at either 1 or 1.5 mM developed with a radialized phenotype with numerous ectopic spicules i  , vi. A Blocking Chordin function using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides severely perturbs D/V polarity.More recently  , the molecular composition and function of the Cullin-3–dependent E3 ligase complex has also been described 43–48. The SCF Skp1-Cullin-1-F-box complexes are  , so far  , the best-characterized Cullin-dependent E3 ligases.At positions 390 and 528 the B6-like amino acid is highly conserved  , mainly in higher organisms  , while the 129-like amino acid at position 528 is also well represented  , particularly among lower organisms. Cross-species alignment of MLH1 proteins Figure 7B shows that the Phe residue at aa192 of the B6 MLH1 protein was fully conserved across the organisms investigated  , with an Ile residue at this position present in 129 strains.What mechanisms keep the caspases from unleashing the cell death program remains an open question  , though the researchers suspect that the localization of caspase inhibitor degradation may curtail apoptosis. Altogether  , their results suggest that the Cullin-3 complex adds ubiquitin tags to caspase inhibitors at the beginning of individualization  , thereby dispatching the inhibitors and giving caspases free rein.Their determining feature is the hydrophobicity of a ten to fifteen residue core sequence  , which surprisingly does not show any sequence conservation 30. However  , the amino-acid composition of signal peptides is extremely variable and the exact mechanism of their recognition by SRP and the translocon is not yet completely understood.To investigate the clinicopathological significance of cystatin M loss and to identify possible factors associated with cystatin M loss in breast cancer  , we analyzed the expression status of five proteins ER  , PR  , HER2  , HER4  , and cystatin M and the hypermethylation of CST6 gene in a total of 292 breast cancer patients. Based on these reports  , we hypothesized that cystatin M may be a downstream target of ER and/or HER4 and that CST6 methylation may be influenced by the alteration of ER and/or HER4.The N-terminal part has at least one positive residue in most of the signals except PpCALP and VSP  , respectively  , whereas the C-terminal part always contains a small and neutral residue at position -1 and -3 with respect to the cleavage site as it is proposed for signal sequences 22 ,23. All of the signals comprise many hydrophobic amino acid residues in their central part indicating the hydrophobic region.In this context it is postulated that the BACK domain may serve as a bridge between Cullin interaction and substrate orientation for optimal ubiquitin attachment. Structural information predicts that the BTB proteins might perform the combined functions of Cullin platform interaction and substrate binding roles of the SKP1 and the F-box subunits respectively of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box SCF E3 ligase 35.OsHAK1 and its two closest homologues  , OsHAK19 and OsHAK20  , in rice share 77% and 75% amino acid sequence identity  , respectively  , and have multiple transmembrane regions S11 and S12 Figs. We frequently identified 16 of 96 in-frame clones cDNA insertions corresponding to the C-terminus of high-affinity K+ transporter OsHAK1  , with the longest cDNA insertion encoding the 110-aa residue C-terminal tail of OsHAK1.Tissue microarrays TMAs of DCISs and IBCs were prepared as described previously 15. Representative stainings of ER  , PR  , HER2  , HER4 and cystatin M expression in DCISs and IBCs are shown in Figure 1.Whereas lysates of wild-type testes displayed significant levels of DEVDase activity  , activity in cul3 mutant testes was reduced to background levels  , comparable to the reduction achieved with the potent caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk Figure 1I and 1J. To provide independent evidence for a requirement of Cullin-3 in caspase activation  , we measured DEVDase activity in cul3 mutant testes.now demonstrate that this intrinsic neuronal potential depends on Chordin and Noggin expression in BCNE cells. Having previously observed that such embryos do develop a central nervous system  , Kuroda et al.These observations suggest that the CSN-3 subunit is also required to maintain the function of intact CSN complexes in protecting cullin-RING E3 ligase adaptor proteins from autoubiquitination. Because the adaptor proteins FWD-1 and DCAF11 are very unstable in the csn-3 strain  , maintenance of functional E3 ligase complexes may rely mostly on newly synthesized FWD-1 and DCAF11 proteins.As predicted  , the dorsal phospho-Smad1/5/8 staining present in control embryos at blastula stages was absent in SB431542 treated embryos Figure 9Bi–iv. Embryos treated with SB431542 fail to express Nodal target genes such as chordin Figure 7Diii and BMP2/4 unpublished data and therefore the endogenous nuclear pSmad1/5/8 staining should be eliminated 14 ,16.
