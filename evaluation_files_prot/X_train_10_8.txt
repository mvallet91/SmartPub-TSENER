The vacuolated enterocytes assemble within hours a pathological organelle with both endosomal and lysosomal components that is similar to the pathological vacuoles that form in epithelial cells of MLIV patients within months. Here we find that the lysosome-containing enterocytes of the suckling period express mucolipin 3 and upregulate mucolipin 1  , and that mice lacking both mucolipins but not only one of the two suffer delayed growth faltering together with pathological vacuolation of enterocytes throughout the period of suckling  , until weaning.Hence  , it appears that mucolipin 3 acts in the postmitotic  , differentiated enterocytes of suckling mice. 1A ,B ,E.Analysis of INSIG1 RNA levels confirmed the activation of INSIG1 expression by hypoxia and knockdown of TET1 decreased the expression of INSIG1 under hypoxia in two different cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR analysis Figure 2d and e and Additional file 6b and c. We further focused on the analysis of INSIG1 gene since HIF-1α inhibits sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c SREBP-1c and suppresses excessive lipid accumulation 22 ,23.Given the co-expression of mucolipins 3 and 1 in suckling enterocytes and the possibility that they may act redundantly i.e.  , be able to replace one another  , we also crossed Trpml3 and Trpml1 mice 12  , 13 to generate Trpml3;Trpml1 double knockouts DKOs. Like Trpml1 mice  , adult Trpml3;Trpml1 mice had no overt phenotype until ∼6 to 8 months of age  , when they developed ataxia due to the lack of mucolipin 1 12  , 13.Further analysis of Tet1 distribution  , using published chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ChIP-Seq datasets 2532  , on genes ordered by level of H3K27me3  , showed that Tet1 binding correlates with Ezh2 and Suz12  , as well as with Sin3a  , a protein recently discovered in complex with Tet1 25 Figure 4A. The above data show a correlation between 5hmC and H3K27me3 distribution on ESC promoters.f SIN3A was knocked down in ESCs by siRNA  , with efficient loss of protein expression. e OGT depletion leads to L1 derepression at the RNA level  , with partial effects also visible in TET1/OGT double knockdown cells; TE classes that are not TET1 targets are also upregulated n = 8 for Ogt KD and n = 3 for Tet1/Ogt KD.Western blot analysis confirmed the upregulation of TET1 protein levels by hypoxia Figure 1a. Exposure of various cell lines to hypoxia showed the activation of TET1 mRNA expression Additional file 1a.Dominant point mutations in the mouse Trpml3 gene result in hyperactive ion channels that are lethal to cells expressing them  , causing deafness due to loss of hair cells and hypopigmentation presumably due to loss of melanocytes in the varitint-waddler Va and Va mice 16–20. Unlike the ubiquitously expressed mucolipin 1  , the paralog mucolipin 3 is expressed in a restricted set of cell types which include hair cells of the inner ear and melanocytes of the skin 15–17.Overexpression of HIF-2α  , but not HIF-1α  , activated the expression of TET1 Figure 1b and data not shown. Western blot analysis confirmed the upregulation of TET1 protein levels by hypoxia Figure 1a.In addition  , using the INSIG1 promoter-driven reporter gene  , the ability of HIF-2α to promote its activity was further enhanced by either TET1 wild-type or TET1-CDmt protein Additional file 12b and c. Similar results were shown using the WDR5 promoter-driven reporter construct Additional file 12a.Both constructs decreased Suz12 protein and H3K27me3 levels without affecting the levels of Tet1 or Sin3a Figure 5C; see Additional file 1: Figure S3. To test whether the Tet1/PRC2 interaction is necessary for DNA hydroxymethylation at H3K27me3 regions  , we silenced Suz12 in ESCs using two different small hairpin shRNAs.Rescue of hypoxia-induced EMT in TET1 knockdown cells by a catalytically inactive TET1 mutant  , and a model to depict the discovery of this report. TAD: transactivation domain of HIF-1α; CXXC: CXXC domain of TET1 protein; CD: catalytic domain of TET1 protein; meC: 5-methylcytosine; me: methyl group; HRE: hypoxia-response element.We also confirmed that SIN3A-mediated L1 derepression involved full-length elements and a concomitant increase of ORF1p protein levels Additional file 2: Figure S7A and B. Moreover  , the effect on L1s was TET1-dependent  , as the upregulation observed on SIN3A KD samples was lost when we knocked down both SIN3A and TET1  , which is in line with the TET1-dependent recruitment of SIN3A to chromatin 28.This weight differential was maintained during the entire period of suckling until P21. 10E  , we found that while mice of all genotypes displayed similar weights at birth  , those lacking both mucolipins but not those lacking only mucolipin 3 or mucolipin 1  , became relatively smaller during their first five days of life  , reaching ∼70% of the weight of wild type mice.Unlike the ubiquitously expressed mucolipin 1  , the paralog mucolipin 3 is expressed in a restricted set of cell types which include hair cells of the inner ear and melanocytes of the skin 15–17. These gain-of-function mutations  , however  , do not clarify the role mucolipin 3 may play in the restricted set of cells expressing it.To test this hypothesis  , reporter gene assays using HIF-1α  , TET1  , CBP CREB binding protein  , and Twist1 promoter-driven reporter construct were performed in 293 T cells. Since there were TET1-regulated genes that did not show difference in the 5hmC levels in their promoters Figure 2b  , we speculated that TET1 may serve as a co-regulator together with HIFs to regulate gene expression.Furthermore  , researchers have fused dCas9 with the catalytic domain of DNMT3A; however  , these tools only methylated up to about 60% at a limited number of CpGs near the guide RNA binding sites 15  , 16. Previously  , researchers were able to demethylate specific regions using either transcription activator-like effector TALE-ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase TET1 or deactivated clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR associated protein 9 dCas9-TET1 fusion protein 13  , 14.10E  , we found that while mice of all genotypes displayed similar weights at birth  , those lacking both mucolipins but not those lacking only mucolipin 3 or mucolipin 1  , became relatively smaller during their first five days of life  , reaching ∼70% of the weight of wild type mice. By comparing the weights of each mutant relative to that of wild types Fig.These gain-of-function mutations  , however  , do not clarify the role mucolipin 3 may play in the restricted set of cells expressing it. Dominant point mutations in the mouse Trpml3 gene result in hyperactive ion channels that are lethal to cells expressing them  , causing deafness due to loss of hair cells and hypopigmentation presumably due to loss of melanocytes in the varitint-waddler Va and Va mice 16–20.Mammals have three mucolipin paralogs  , encoded by the genes Trpml1  , 2 and 3. Mucolipins are cation channels present in the membranes of lysosomes and late endosomes 7–9.Our previous results indicated that wild-type HIF-1α could be stably expressed in 293 T cells due to the overexpression of HIF-1α that is beyond the HIF-1α degradation activity under normoxia 6 ,11. To test this hypothesis  , reporter gene assays using HIF-1α  , TET1  , CBP CREB binding protein  , and Twist1 promoter-driven reporter construct were performed in 293 T cells.Suz12 silencing resulted in a significant reduction of global DNA hydroxymethylation Figure 5D; see Additional file 1: Figure S3. Both constructs decreased Suz12 protein and H3K27me3 levels without affecting the levels of Tet1 or Sin3a Figure 5C; see Additional file 1: Figure S3.Here we find that the lysosome-containing enterocytes of the suckling period express mucolipin 3 and upregulate mucolipin 1  , and that mice lacking both mucolipins but not only one of the two suffer delayed growth faltering together with pathological vacuolation of enterocytes throughout the period of suckling  , until weaning. Following enterocyte vacuolation is a reduction of endocytosis from the intestinal lumen  , a presumed cause for a deficiency in nutrient uptake that would account for the delayed growth.d Western blot for ORF1p also shows no difference in expression at the protein level. c Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-qPCR data of TET1- and/or TET2-depleted ESCs  , at four or ten days following lentiviral shRNA delivery n = 6; no statistically significant differences are detected t-test.These results indicate that TET1 may serve as a co-activator to enhance the transactivation activity of either HIF-1α or HIF-2α. In addition  , using the INSIG1 promoter-driven reporter gene  , the ability of HIF-2α to promote its activity was further enhanced by either TET1 wild-type or TET1-CDmt protein Additional file 12b and c.TAD: transactivation domain of HIF-1α; CXXC: CXXC domain of TET1 protein; CD: catalytic domain of TET1 protein; meC: 5-methylcytosine; me: methyl group; HRE: hypoxia-response element. Red arrow indicates the process of demethylation of 5mC by TET1.The upregulation of mucolipin 1 and selective expression of mucolipin 3 in suckling enterocytes is in keeping with the high activity of endolysosomal system in these cells  , which use these organelles to uptake and digest nutrients from milk 1  , 3  , 4. Hence  , we propose that a mucolipin-endowed endolysosomal system in enterocytes or other specialized nutrient absorbing cells of the young plays an evolutionarily conserved role in the intracellular digestion of maternally-provided nutrients  , whether milk in mammals or yolk in oviparous species.The slow onset of these subcellular abnormalities pose an obstacle to elucidating how the pathological vacuolation occurs in the absence of mucolipin 1  , and have also led to the suspicion that other channels  , perhaps mucolipins 2 or 3  , may partially compensate for the loss of mucolipin 1. Cells of MLIV patients and Trpml1
−/− mice display enlarged lysosomal vacuoles that are largely empty or accumulate various undigested substances  , depending on cell type  , but that typically contain membranous bodies with concentric lipid membranes 11  , 14.Neither ISH nor IHC detected expression of Trpml3 in the space between the villi  , also called intervillus pockets and crypts  , where the intestinal stem cells that produce the enterocytes reside 27 Fig. Hence  , it appears that mucolipin 3 acts in the postmitotic  , differentiated enterocytes of suckling mice.Mutations in human Trpml1 also known as Mcoln1 cause mucolipidosis type IV  , a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by severe psychomotor retardation and ophthalmological abnormalities that typically appear months after birth but within the first year of life 10  , 11. Mammals have three mucolipin paralogs  , encoded by the genes Trpml1  , 2 and 3.Interestingly  , embryonic enterocytes of nematodes also express the mucolipin CUP-5  , which they require for the endolysosomal uptake and digestion of yolk 51. The upregulation of mucolipin 1 and selective expression of mucolipin 3 in suckling enterocytes is in keeping with the high activity of endolysosomal system in these cells  , which use these organelles to uptake and digest nutrients from milk 1  , 3  , 4.Previously  , researchers were able to demethylate specific regions using either transcription activator-like effector TALE-ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase TET1 or deactivated clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR associated protein 9 dCas9-TET1 fusion protein 13  , 14. In order to investigate the relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression  , there has been significant interest in generating tools to specifically methylate or demethylate regions in a targeted manner.
