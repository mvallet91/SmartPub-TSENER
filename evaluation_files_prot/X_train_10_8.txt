In the embryo  , both SoxN and D are expressed and required to control the establishment of neural stem cells and  , later  , they control the proneural genes achaete scute and asense in neural stem cells called neuroblasts in flies 4. The fly genome contains four SoxB genes  , but only two are expressed in the developing embryonic nervous system: SoxNeuro SoxN  , which belongs to the SoxB1 group  , and Dichaete D  , which is closer to the SoxB2 family.C-D Immunofluorescence staining for podocyte markers Wt1  , Synaptopodin and structural markers phalloidin  , laminin show no obvious misorganization in Arhgap35 glomeruli  , either pre- or post-cyst formation arrowheads. B Quantification of the average density of H&E-stained glomeruli normalized to kidney area shows no difference between control and Arhgap35 animals unpaired  , two-tailed Student’s t-test.2004  , and the mrkAB genes that are involved in the production of mannose-resistant fimbriae and biofilm formation Jagnow and Clegg 2003. 2007  , the ybbW and allBCRAS genes of the allantoinase gene cluster  , involved in the metabolism of allatonin Chou et al.2007  , the ybbW and allBCRAS genes of the allantoinase gene cluster  , involved in the metabolism of allatonin Chou et al. These K. pneumoniae virulence genes include the fyuA and ybtAPTQ genes of the yersiniabactin gene cluster  , involved in iron acquisition Lawlor et al.In another part of the developing Drosophila nervous system called the medial column  , both D and SOXN activate the expression of achaete scute  , leading to the transition from stem cell state to neuron 4. In both of those cases  , SOXB proteins have maintained opposite functions in the regulation of proneural genes to promote neural fate.E Section immunofluorescence for cilia acetylated α-tubulin and the podocyte lineage podocalyxin shows normal cilia in Bowman’s capsule cells visualized with DAPI. C-D Immunofluorescence staining for podocyte markers Wt1  , Synaptopodin and structural markers phalloidin  , laminin show no obvious misorganization in Arhgap35 glomeruli  , either pre- or post-cyst formation arrowheads.
