Many of the distinguishing features of plants are attributable to the functions of highly specialized cells. These advances rely on fluorescent protein markers that have enabled the tracking and isolation of cell populations of particular identity.Taken together with the determined structures  , the in vitro and in vivo experiments enabled us to create a protein interaction map of the IscS surface Figure 6B. These results support that TusA and ThiI bind to distinct but partially overlapping regions on the IscS surface.The progress of CRISPR screen technology enabled systematic and reliable determination of gene essentiality under diverse conditions. These previous works on RNAi screen indicate that the CRISPR screen result quality may also be improved by integration with protein interaction networks.The Nematode Expression Pattern Database Kohara 2001; http://nematode.lab.nig.ac.jp/db/index.html and green fluorescent protein GFP reporters enabled us to identify 37 early-onset and 34 late-onset pharyngeal genes Table S2. We categorized the pharyngeal genes into early versus late temporal groups using previously defined expression patterns.A six-frame translation coupled with searches amongst confirmed ABC transporter protein sequences enabled us to assign each transcript into the correct reading frame for analysis. The remaining 1295 1KP samples were translated into six frames using the Transeq program from EMBOSS The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite 26.The chromosomal location of UCPs and the protein ID in each species are shown in Table 2. The search for UCP orthologues in vertebrates enabled their identification in a variety of species including mammalians  , reptiles  , birds and amphibians.Yeast cells contain several mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK pathways  , and elegant studies in the mid-1990s identified the cascade of Ste11p  , Ste7p  , and Kss1p as a pseudohyphal growth activator 21–23. Pseudohyphal formation in S. cerevisiae is enabled by changes in cell polarity  , cytoskeletal organization  , and cell adhesion controlled through a regulatory network encompassing a core set of strongly conserved signaling modules 17–20.The fusion of the synthetic spider silks to 100xELP enabled protein purification via membrane-based inverse transition cycling mITC 34. High expressing plants were cropped into soil and grown in a greenhouse for 4 to 6 weeks prior to harvesting the leaves.IKAP is a well-studied protein  , yet its role in neuronal survival remains controversial. These CKO FD mice enabled us to study the role of IKAP in neuronal maintenance in vivo and to establish the mechanism by which PS improves symptoms of neurodegeneration.The sequenced genomes enabled phylogenetic inference from multiple concatenated protein sequences and these efforts  , using respectively 32 18 and 213 protein sequences 19  , both repositioned the root from a location between groups 1 and 2 to a location that separated the four groups into two branches  , with branch I containing groups 1 and 2 and branch II  , groups 3 and 4. D. lacteum in group 3 15  , Polyspondylium pallidum in group 2  , clade 2B 16  , Acytostelium subglobosum in group 2 clade 2A 17 and D. fasciculatum in group 1 16.The observed positive selection on protein residues and functional shift in protein sequences could have enabled successful pathogen-host interaction in P. lilacinum. Subtilisin-like proteins are known to play crucial role in trapping and pathogenesis of nematode in nematophagous fungi 12  , 21–23.Our Pacman-based mutants enabled us to directly determine potential requirements of the intracellular regulation of the Nrg–Ankyrin interaction for GF circuit formation and function. Previous analysis of nrg mutations affecting either homophilic cell adhesion properties nrg or protein levels nrg identified both axon guidance and synaptic defects at the GF terminal 55 ,56.The sequencing of DNA of various eukaryotic genomes  , such as for murine 21 ,105 and primate 22 ,23 as well as many others  , has enabled a comparative genomics strategy to refine the identification of orthologous genes. This revealed an unexpected paucity of protein coding genes 20 ,000–25 ,000 residing in less than 2% of the DNA examined  , suggesting that alternative transcription and splicing of genes are equally important in development and differentiation 19 ,20.Similarity of the predicted protein sequences at the 3' ends enabled Malik and Eickbush 17 to recognize that some families previously classified as SINEs were actually truncated RTE elements  , just as it has enabled us to recognize RTE elements within isolated microsatellite markers. In the absence of a full-length RTE sequence as evidence  , such truncated RTE elements may be misidentified as short interspersed nucleotide elements SINEs; 17 which by contrast are usually derived from abundant cellular RNAs  , lack coding potential  , possess polyA tails  , are independently transcribed from their own internal Pol III promoters  , and utilize proteins encoded by other retro-elements for their insertion.The search for UCP1 ortologues in vertebrates enabled its identification in mammals Human  , Mouse  , etc. The chromosomal location of UCPs and the protein ID in each species are shown in Table 2.Tubule sections from 14d mutants revealed that TUNEL-positive cells were located 2 to 3 cell layers in from the basal lamina membrane most mature germ cells are found in the center of a tubule cross-section and all were SCP1-negative. To determine which cell type and what stage of meiosis were affected  , we combined TUNEL staining and immunofluorescence for SCP1 synaptonemal complex protein 1  , a combination that enabled us to distinguish between meiotic and non-meiotic cells and also between meiotic cells of different stages.These advances rely on fluorescent protein markers that have enabled the tracking and isolation of cell populations of particular identity. Tissue-specific profiling has also shown that environmental conditions lead to dramatically different responses in various cell types 5  , 6.Lastly  , an analysis of intron conservation in ribosomal protein genes among 12 tested species allowed us to draw conclusions about how ribosomal protein gene RPG intron function might have evolved. Furthermore  , we found clear examples of intron loss accompanied by insertion of additional codons  , at least one case of intron sliding  , and we have shown that the uncoupling of snoRNAs from introns of some genes was enabled by WGD.To date  , this enhanced specificity has enabled multiplexed detection of antigens in 1 μL plasma samples 28 and even single-cell lysates 31. In these examples  , cellular RNA and protein expression were simultaneously profiled by splitting the lysate from a single cell in half  , three unequal portions 20:40:40  , or half  , respectively.Transgenes encoding the membrane-associated CD8-green fluorescent protein GFP or cytoplasmic β-Galactosidase β-Gal were used to visualize DCN axons. Therefore  , the use of the atoGal4-14a driver enabled us to evaluate candidate genes acting specifically during DCN innervation of the optic lobes.When green fluorescent protein GFP-labeled cells were allowed to rest at room temperature for 2 h  , we observed the formation of cell aggregates that produced higher scattering and a fluorescence signal defining a new gate  , Rflag bacterial aggregates fluorescence channel 1 region in bacteria records Figure 2E. This enabled us to determine a cell unitary fluorescence value fl
i from the mean FL1 fluorescence of an Rflb gate bacteria region containing the fluorescent bacteria Figure 2B.Elastic penetration moduli E were calculated from the recorded load penetration curves. E-values were calculated from a large series of 1225 indentations  , which were performed for each protein layer with an orthogonal and lateral inter-sampling point distance of 715 nm and this enabled the statistically evident calculation of E for each material Additional file 1.At the end of the experiment  , the explants were fixed and immunostained for markers of pancreatic progenitors SOX9 and endocrine progenitors NEUROG3 S1F–I Fig. After 24 h of settling time  , we initiated high-magnification time-lapse live imaging in 3-D with 6-min intervals for up to 24 h. Nuclear H2B-GFP fusion protein enabled us to observe cell divisions and to track individual cell nuclei.We first inserted a single-copy enhanced green fluorescent protein EGFP reporter gene in the DT40 genome  , so that inactivation of the EGFP could be easily detected through fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS analysis  , in a similar way to that used to study AID-dependent mutations 36. A derivative DT40 clone in which AID has been knocked out sIgM+ ψV− AID−/− 38 has enabled us to assay the effects of APOBEC1 in the absence of other DNA mutators.Measurements of the fraction of a given transcript associated with polyribosomes  , together with the average spacing of ribosomes along the mRNA  , allows estimation of the efficiency of translation and hence the rate of synthesis of the encoded protein 3. Sucrose-gradient centrifugation  , coupled with genome-wide transcript measurements  , has enabled genome-level analysis of ribosome loading on individual transcript species 1 ,3.We combined this separation with online reversed-phase LC RPLC in the first dimension to separate histone families and FTMS to enhance MS characterization of intact histones. successfully developed an alternative 'saltless' pH gradient WCX-HILIC for online middle-down proteomic analysis of human histone H3.2  , which enabled an approximately 100-fold reduction in sample requirements and analysis time 8.Similarly  , in this study we utilized a salt-free pH-gradient WCX-HILIC 8 as the second dimension for separating differentially acetylated/methylated intact protein isoforms within each histone family H4  , H2B  , H2A  , H3.This is because it is easier to recognize homology of divergent protein sequences than nucleotide sequences. Similarity of the predicted protein sequences at the 3' ends enabled Malik and Eickbush 17 to recognize that some families previously classified as SINEs were actually truncated RTE elements  , just as it has enabled us to recognize RTE elements within isolated microsatellite markers.Crick recognized that there might be some unknown source of information that enabled proteins to fold  , but he argued that the ‘more likely hypothesis’ was that ‘folding is simply a function of the order of the amino acids.’ In other words  , 3D protein structure is an emergent property of the 1D sequence. Proteins are 3-dimensional 3D structures whereas a DNA sequence is 1-dimensional 1D.Introduction of EEF1A-based vectors superseding CMV-based types has enabled smaller numbers of cell clones to be screened and evaluated by increasing the mean level of target protein expression. Creation of mammalian cell lines that express high levels of recombinant protein and maintain stable production levels over several months of cultivation is still a very time-consuming and labour-intensive process.Kinetoplastibacterium crithidii UP000010479  , which consist of 14 ,609 and 739 entries  , respectively  , were considered for protein identification. Data-dependent tandem mass spectra were acquired in positive mode and analyzed within the MaxQuant software environment version 1.5.3.8  , MPI for Biochemistry  , Planegg  , Germany using standard parameters; label-free quantification was enabled and the UniProtKB proteome datasets for A. deanei UP000015341 and its endosymbiont Ca.The culture was maintained in exponential phase prior to transfer to a microtiter plate. This technology enabled us to measure the galactose GAL pathway activity dynamics in single cells using the epimerase GAL10 promoter pGAL10 driving Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein  , YFP and to dissect the quantitative growth patterns of the microbial culture.Peptides identified by LC-MS/MS measurements were compared to a protein database generated by reverse translation of all potential coding sequences of the newt transcriptome using all possible reading frames. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture SILAC of newt tissues enabled us to filter for mass shifted spectra  , which increased the quality of the dataset considerably 11.E-values were calculated from a large series of 1225 indentations  , which were performed for each protein layer with an orthogonal and lateral inter-sampling point distance of 715 nm and this enabled the statistically evident calculation of E for each material Additional file 1. AFM-based nanoindentation was performed to assess the elastic penetration modulus E. For that reason  , the same AFM instrument was used to record and evaluate load penetration curves according to an advanced Hertzian model for spherical indenter geometry 27 ,55 as a course of the load dependent on a penetration depth between 10 to 15 nm.In this article  , we report a novel high-throughput and high-sensitivity platform for comprehensive characterization of combinatorial histone PTMs at the intact protein level. The platform enabled unambiguous identification of 708 histone isoforms from a single analysis of 7.5 μg HeLa core histones.Since no genome sequences for group-intermediate species were available  , their positions remained unresolved. The sequenced genomes enabled phylogenetic inference from multiple concatenated protein sequences and these efforts  , using respectively 32 18 and 213 protein sequences 19  , both repositioned the root from a location between groups 1 and 2 to a location that separated the four groups into two branches  , with branch I containing groups 1 and 2 and branch II  , groups 3 and 4.The patients were participants in a randomized trial analyzing the benefit from adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen  , which enabled us to investigate the treatment predictive value of HOXB13. In the present study  , we used immunohistochemistry to analyze the protein expression of HOXB13 in tumor samples from 912 postmenopausal breast cancer patients.However  , assaying biological events occurring on cell membranes  , including signal transduction and intercellular communication  , has proven to be considerably more difficult to industrialize in microarray format. DNA and protein microarrays have enabled the measurement of gene expression and biomarkers on an unprecedented scale  , and have greatly affected fields ranging from oncology to medical diagnostics.This technology enabled us to measure the galactose GAL pathway activity dynamics in single cells using the epimerase GAL10 promoter pGAL10 driving Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein  , YFP and to dissect the quantitative growth patterns of the microbial culture. 1A 16.Indeed  , replacement of the E. coli pmrD gene by the Salmonella homolog enabled activation of the E. coli PmrA/PmrB system in low Mg2+
23. The inability of E. coli to activate the PmrA/PmrB system  , and thus  , to resist killing by polymyxin B in low Mg2+  , has been attributed to its PmrD protein being highly divergent from the Salmonella PmrD 23.For protein/peptide identification MS/MS data was searched against both uniprot swissprot amino acid sequence database non-redundant database with reviewed proteins and Uniprot TrEMBL database database with unreviewed proteins downloaded in August 2013 using an in-house mascot server version 2.4 through Proteome Discoverer 1.3 software. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with one count during 30 s and an exclusion period of 180 s. The exclusion mass width was set to 0.01.The ETHR gene encodes two functionally distinct subtypes of G protein coupled receptors ETHR-A and -B through alternative splicing. Identification of the Ecdysis Triggering Hormone receptor ETHR gene in Drosophila melanogaster enabled elucidation of a complex downstream signaling cascade triggered by ETH 5.Genes encoding lysosomal enzymes  , such as cathepsins S  , Z  , and D were each increased several-fold. The expression of cystatin F  , α2-macroglobulin  , and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP were also markedly increased.After 24 h of settling time  , we initiated high-magnification time-lapse live imaging in 3-D with 6-min intervals for up to 24 h. Nuclear H2B-GFP fusion protein enabled us to observe cell divisions and to track individual cell nuclei. 1B 25 ,26.In addition to in silico gating  , our data enabled directed questions of how the levels of upstream protein regulators and downstream RNA targets covary within known pathways. 4b–d.The explosion in sequencing technologies has enabled exploration of the transcriptome at unprecedented depth 3. Over the past decade there has been an increasing appreciation of the importance of RNA-protein interactions in controlling many aspects of gene regulation 1 ,2.We would like to emphasize that these numbers most likely represent only the tip of the iceberg since the current sensitivity and dynamic range of mass spectrometry only allows measurement of high abundance proteins. This approach not only enabled us to validate almost 15 ,000 transcripts as protein coding but also enabled the identification of 826 urodelian-specific proteins  , which showed either no sequence similarity at all 583 transcripts or similarities to urodele EST sequences only 243 transcripts.This enabled us to maintain CDK activity below the S phase threshold for much longer periods of time. As cells accumulate the Cdc13-Cdc2 fusion protein during a prolonged G1 arrest 13  , the cultures initially released from G2 were kept in 2 μM 3-MBPP1 for 30 min and subsequently treated with 20 μM inhibitor.At times shortly after gene transfer  , the HSV-1 immediate early IE 4/5 promoter in pHSVlac 22 supports expression in most cell types  , which enabled an accurate assessment of the types of transduced cells. Specifically  , 75 to 80% of the transduced cells were nigrostriatal neurons  , compared to 15–30% using untargeted gene transfer; and for the untargeted expression  , 5 to 10% was in each of GABAergic neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein-containing cells 21.He called this link “the flow of information” and added this concept to the factors that were generally accepted to describe protein synthesis and  , indeed  , life itself—the flow of matter and the flow of energy. This in turn enabled Crick to conceptualize the link between gene and protein.To detect specific stages of evolution and positive selection in Proteinase K gene family  , branch site models were employed to search for amino acid sites under positive selection in branches for 3 clade branch sites: “Nectriaceae”  , “Cordycipitaceae/Clavicipitaceae” and “Ophiocordycipitaceae”. The observed positive selection on protein residues and functional shift in protein sequences could have enabled successful pathogen-host interaction in P. lilacinum.To our knowledge  , there are no studies investigating the HOXB13 protein levels in breast cancer and its significance in predicting outcome after tamoxifen treatment. The patients were participants in a randomized trial analyzing the benefit from adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen  , which enabled us to investigate the treatment predictive value of HOXB13.However  , a secondary mutation was later identified  , which  , when corrected  , enabled the N52D/N66D Bcl-xL to bind Bim  , casting doubt on this interpretation 13. Initial work from the Weintraub laboratory suggested that when Asn52 and Asn66 are both mutated to Asp  , then Bcl-xL loses its ability to bind to the BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein Bim  , thereby providing a putative linkage between DNA damage and apoptosis 9.The application of massively parallel sequencing technologies to characterize cancer genomes provides a foundation that not only has enabled the discovery of targets in particular cancers but also  , in some cases  , has informed the selection of therapeutic agents 1. Two recent breast cancer studies utilizing both a broad 2 and a focused approach 3 to interrogate protein and epigenetic modifications have suggested the types of additional information needed to allow us to understand cancer dependencies more fully.The set of early-expressed pharyngeal genes Ph-E contained genes whose expression initiated by mid-embryogenesis the “bean” to “comma” stages; Sulston et al. The Nematode Expression Pattern Database Kohara 2001; http://nematode.lab.nig.ac.jp/db/index.html and green fluorescent protein GFP reporters enabled us to identify 37 early-onset and 34 late-onset pharyngeal genes Table S2.This simple ‘sequence hypothesis ,’ as he termed it  , remains essentially true today  , despite the acknowledged role of molecular chaperones. Crick recognized that there might be some unknown source of information that enabled proteins to fold  , but he argued that the ‘more likely hypothesis’ was that ‘folding is simply a function of the order of the amino acids.’ In other words  , 3D protein structure is an emergent property of the 1D sequence.This approach not only enabled us to validate almost 15 ,000 transcripts as protein coding but also enabled the identification of 826 urodelian-specific proteins  , which showed either no sequence similarity at all 583 transcripts or similarities to urodele EST sequences only 243 transcripts. Since the lack of information about newt proteins makes it difficult to distinguish between these possibilities  , we took advantage of a large set of proteomics data from newts obtained by mass spectrometry.Indeed  , we recently demonstrated single-cell resolution for PEA-based protein measurements in multiwell plates while co-detecting RNA via qRT-PCR 31  , echoing a previous report on a small panel of DNA  , protein  , and RNA targets 32  , and in line with recent work that used PLA and qRT-PCR in reverse-emulsion droplets to examine the levels of a single protein and RNA 33. To date  , this enhanced specificity has enabled multiplexed detection of antigens in 1 μL plasma samples 28 and even single-cell lysates 31.The telomere binding protein TRF2 interacts with TERRA RNA G-quadruplexes to promote telomere heterochromatinization 15  , 16. Use of a novel dual-pyrene probe specific for TERRA RNA G-quadruplexes has enabled direct imaging of TERRA G4 RNA at the telomeres in human cells 14.successfully developed an alternative 'saltless' pH gradient WCX-HILIC for online middle-down proteomic analysis of human histone H3.2  , which enabled an approximately 100-fold reduction in sample requirements and analysis time 8.Similarly  , in this study we utilized a salt-free pH-gradient WCX-HILIC 8 as the second dimension for separating differentially acetylated/methylated intact protein isoforms within each histone family H4  , H2B  , H2A  , H3. Recently  , Young et al.To determine which cell type and what stage of meiosis were affected  , we combined TUNEL staining and immunofluorescence for SCP1 synaptonemal complex protein 1  , a combination that enabled us to distinguish between meiotic and non-meiotic cells and also between meiotic cells of different stages. These results suggested loss of germ cells as the animals first proceed through meiosis.The mutation W45IscSR decreases both mnm5s2U and s4U levels to about 5% of the wild-type protein  , confirming that Trp45 affects binding to TusA and ThiI Table 3 and 21. Taken together with the determined structures  , the in vitro and in vivo experiments enabled us to create a protein interaction map of the IscS surface Figure 6B.This in turn enabled Crick to conceptualize the link between gene and protein. In his 1957 lecture  , Crick gave a disarmingly straightforward definition—information in this context was simply ‘the determination of a sequence of units.’ This highlighted the existence of a link between the base sequences of nucleic acids and those of amino acids in a protein—they pointed to the reality of the genetic code.It has been postulated that the Gly538–Asp531 hydrogen bond was enabled by the flexibility of glycine residue owing to its small size  , which allows it to adopt backbone conformations that are not accessible for other amino acids. When molecular dynamics simulation studies of the wild-type and D538G mutant proteins were performed in the absence of ligand and bound to a coactivator protein  , TIF2  , a hydrogen-bonding interaction was noted between the backbone of Gly538 and the side chain of Asp351 that resulted in shifting of G538 towards helix H3 in the mutant receptor that was not present in the wild-type protein 28.Expression of this fluorescent marker by virtually all GABAergic populations enabled us to distinguish and isolate GABAergic from GFP-negative  , non-GABAergic and largely excitatory  , neuronal populations. To examine whether two SNAP-25 isoforms are differentially expressed in GABAergic neurons and therefore might play a role in tailoring the distinct properties of synaptic activity in these neurons  , we utilized GAD67-GFP Δneo transgenic mice that bear a knockin insertion of green fluorescent protein eGFP coding sequence at the glutamate decarboxylase 67 GAD67 gene locus 32.The expression of cystatin F  , α2-macroglobulin  , and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP were also markedly increased. Protease inhibitors were among the most highly upregulated genes; for example  , serpin3An was induced approximately 4  , 14 and 20-fold at 3  , 5 and 8 months in the PPT1 knockout brain.We have presented a new method for simultaneously quantifying several proteins and RNAs from the same single cell in a single series of reactions  , which we have validated with select in situ hybridization and IF experiments  , as well as recombinant protein  , bulk cell lysate  , and ERCC Spike-In dilutions. Moreover  , since the unique dataset obtained via our generalized approach enabled many in silico experiments from a single in vitro experiment  , we were able to discern how the levels of specific proteins and RNAs impact the expression of all other measured targets  , saving time and money compared to conventional approaches 3–8  , 10  , 21–24.We were able to purify recombinant proteins fused to Archaea partners by heating E. coli lysates and to show that the treatment enabled  , at the same time  , to select monodispersed proteins because aggregated fusion proteins precipitated during the heat treatment 9. 8 showed that thermotolerance of VH domains correlated with their yields of recombinant soluble protein.We have modified existing EEF1A-based vectors by linking the DHFR selection marker and target gene in the bicistronic RNA  , shortening the overall plasmid size  , and adding an EBVTR element. Introduction of EEF1A-based vectors superseding CMV-based types has enabled smaller numbers of cell clones to be screened and evaluated by increasing the mean level of target protein expression.Ortholog-Finder parameters were set to the defaults  , with the exception being that HGT filtering was enabled. The protein sequences  , translated from predicted ORFs  , were obtained from the NCBI site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.Within an overall increase in domains involved in regulation  , our results show that animal evolution on a genome level is specifically associated with enrichment of protein domains involved in DNA-dependent transcriptional regulation  , cell-matrix adhesion  , apoptosis programmed cell death  , signal transduction for example  , G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling  , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MAPKK activity  , and various aspects of immune system functions in particular cytokine and major histocompatibility complex-related domains. Applying GO term enrichment analysis  , as commonly employed for microarray analysis 48  , to the functions of lost and gained domains enabled us to obtain a more detailed view of the interplay between domain losses and gains Tables 3 and 4.Positioning of the trans-activating fusion protein was realized by Tet-operator upstream of the gene of interest 46. High gene expression was enabled by the use of a VP16 herpes simplex virus transactivator fused to the E. coli Tet-repressor.His/her community members can also contribute as well as benefit from mappings created by the scientist. In the given scenario  , a biologist will be enabled to match the concepts standing for protein in the ontologies of chemists and biologists  , and benefit from being easily aware of the community-driven changes.DNA and protein microarrays have enabled the measurement of gene expression and biomarkers on an unprecedented scale  , and have greatly affected fields ranging from oncology to medical diagnostics. lithographic modification of the solid support to allow selective deposition of membranes 9 ,10 ,12 ,13 or modification of the planar bilayer following deposition 11.For example  , genetic networks have been elucidated by high-throughput screens for synthetic lethality 46  , protein interaction networks have been mapped using mass spectrometry 47 ,48  , and transcriptional networks have been elucidated by the now-ubiquitous technique of transcriptional profiling using microarrays and by the mapping of physical interactions between transcription factors and promoters 49. The pursuit of an integrated understanding of yeast functional genomics and proteomics reviewed in 45 has been enabled by numerous powerful high-throughput approaches.Since well-annotated genomes exist for only a handful of species analyzed and most species lacked sufficiently large and diverse tissue sequencing results  , alternative splice variants were not considered. A six-frame translation coupled with searches amongst confirmed ABC transporter protein sequences enabled us to assign each transcript into the correct reading frame for analysis.Recently  , PHA synthase engineering enabled production of the beta-galactosidase and GFP fusion proteins  , respectively  , at the PHA granule surface 9 ,10. Phasins and their fusion proteins have been increasingly considered for protein production at the PHA granule surface 2 ,6-8.In the given scenario  , a biologist will be enabled to match the concepts standing for protein in the ontologies of chemists and biologists  , and benefit from being easily aware of the community-driven changes. In fact  , it extends and preserves advantages given to the communities by the ordinary Web.Figure 8b shows that CHX treatment leads to detection of the otherwise highly unstable endogenous poison cassette exon-containing SR protein transcripts that increase in abundance upon SRSF3 over-expression. The use of CHX as a tool also enabled us to investigate the alternative splicing outcome of endogenous transcripts.
