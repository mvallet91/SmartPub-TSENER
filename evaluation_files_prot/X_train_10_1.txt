To determine the consistency of treatment benefit for PFS across both subgroups  , the interaction p value was obtained from the stratified Cox proportional hazard model that included treatment  , subgroup  , and treatment by subgroup interaction terms.   , prior hormonal therapy status  , prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy status  , de novo disease status  , race  , estrogen/progesterone receptor status  , and selected biomarkers.Ncoa4 nuclear receptor co-activator 4 and FOXA1 forkhead-box A1  , both have been shown to act as transcriptional activators of estrogen ER-α 36 ,37. Included among these are Sirt1  , Hey2  , Ncoa4  , and Foxa1  , all of which have been implicated in the progression of luminal breast cancer and ER-α-dependent signaling  , as well as ER-α that is  , Esr 1 Additional file 2.Indeed  , a whole series of intracellular events  , such as the rapid phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK ERK1/2  , the activation of PI3-kinase PI3K and phospholipase C PLC  , the increase in cAMP concentrations and the intracellular calcium mobilization  , was shown to follow GPER activation by both estrogens and anti-estrogens 20. The early discovery 8 of a transmembrane receptor able to mediate estrogen responsiveness in ER-negative breast cancer cells was then confirmed by several reports by which GPER was considered as a genuine ER 10 ,19.We found that the two ER+ samples that successfully grew propagatable tumors in SCID mice lost their ER expression generally by the second passage even when the mice were supplemented with estrogen. Staining was also performed in all tumors for ER  , progesterone receptor PR  , and Her2 amplification.It is possible that more complex mechanism underlies our model  , but it is still unequivocal that COUP-TFII has access to the principal part of steroid receptor regulation in the uterine biology. LIF is known to be estrogen responsive; when examined  , we did not find significant changes in LIF by qRT-PCR and by immunocytochemistry in mutants in comparison to the controls.The data monitor 3 ,389 genes across 30 estrogen-receptor-negative and 28 estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer samples 33 ,34.However  , the underlying molecular mechanisms remain undefined. Genomic amplification of BAF57/SMARCE1  , a core subunit of human SWI/SNF complexes that plays a role in interaction with transcription factors and chromatin  , has been linked to high risk of recurrence of estrogen/progesterone receptor-negative breast tumors 12.We defined hormone receptor positive patients as estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive HR positive and HR-negative if negative for both. Dominant distant recurrence site was 1 soft tissue if distant lymph nodes or skin metastases but not bone or visceral  , 2 bone if bone metastases with or without soft tissue or visceral  , and 3 visceral if metastases to organs with or without bone or soft tissue involvement.More recent improvement of the risk assessment is obtained through the molecular characterization of the tumor and identifies patients who are predicted to obtain the most therapeutic benefit 7-15. Risk assessment is of utmost importance because of the well-known side effects of adjuvant treatment and is being conducted by means of TNM classification and differentiation grade complemented by estrogen and progesterone receptor status  , Her2neu expression and peritumoral vascular invasion 2-6.As shown in Figure 5  , treatment of estrogen-deprived MCF-7 cells with CSNO or auranofin  , added separately or in combination  , induced an almost exclusively nuclear localization of ERα  , with a clear reduction of the cytoplasmic levels of the receptor. Since p53 also appeared to be involved in the observed increase in proliferation  , the subcellular distribution of this protein was also analyzed.In contrast  , most observational studies either report no influence of or a favorable effect of MHT on prognostic variables such as tumor size  , lymph node involvement  , tumor grade  , or receptor status 3-14. The only randomized controlled trial comparing estrogen–progestin therapy with placebo therapy found women in the treated arm to have slightly larger tumors with a higher proportion of lymph node involvement compared with those in the untreated arm 2.The most profound effects on gene expression profiles in breast cancer are related to estrogen ER  , and proliferation status  , and to a lesser extent to Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 HER2 status. Different molecular subtypes of breast cancer have been described 1.In other PQQ-producing bacteria  , the peptidase-like protein PqqF is required for PQQ synthesis and has a similar function as the TldD in G. oxydans 32. The TldD protein of G. oxydans 621H  , related to the E. coli TldD  , is a peptidase involved in processing of small peptides.This is exemplified by the advent of therapeutic agents targeting estrogen-receptor positive ER+ and HER2-positive HER2+ breast cancers  , which make up approximately 70% of all breast tumours 2 ,3. Recognition that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease has helped shape advances in therapy  , leading to more targeted therapeutic strategies and improved survival rates in discrete disease subgroups 1.An additional indicator of estrogen signaling activity in breast tumors is the higher expression of known estrogen-inducible targets  , such as progesterone receptor PR. 20 and identified 50 genes from cluster B that were significantly correlated with PGR p < 0.05 in both the van de Vijver and Wang datasets Figure 3  , where about half the number of genes would have been expected by chance p < 0.0001  , Fisher's exact.Breast cancer overall shows a bimodal distribution with respect to age  , with the first peak occurring at age 50 years more commonly medullary or inflammatory breast cancer  , and the second peak reached at over 70 years of age more commonly estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive lobular or mucinous cancers 20. We postulate that biologic aging in female breast tissue may be accelerated beginning at puberty  , and may be linked to stimulation by estrogen  , progesterone  , and oxytocin  , and cell cycling  , so that by early adulthood the DNAm age in female breast is higher than that of other tissues  , as we observe.One group was characterized by over-expression of ERBB2  , the steroid hormone receptor AR  , and genes related to steroid estrogen response such as GATA3  , TFF1  , and DNALI1. Using hierarchical clustering with Pearson correlation metric and complete linkage  , we found that samples clustered into five main groups  , each characterized by the expression patterns of four gene clusters that were found to be strongly enriched for specific gene ontologies Figure 3a and Additional data file 3.In accordance with these data  , comparative clinical studies have indicated that aromatase inhibitors blocking estrogen biosynthesis may provide major benefits in respect to ERα antagonists in breast cancer patients 46. On the basis of the main role exerted by ERα in the development and progression of breast cancer and considering that this receptor is expressed in approximately 70% of breast tumors  , the ER antagonist tamoxifen has been widely used  , although its effectiveness is limited by de novo and acquired resistance 45.Correlation between averaged estrogen I and progesterone J receptor levels in cores ERS/PR positive = 1 and ERS/PR negative = 0 correlated with PrP scores. H. Comparison of the mean intensity score mean ± SEM of PrP immunostaining in breast tissue cores showing Low 0 to 1 or High BiP 2 to 3 immunostaining scores.We named this model the FC FoxN1fx/fx/CreERT mouse and FF FoxN1fx/fx without CreERT for controls mouse. To determine whether the capacity of newly generated tTreg cells is impaired in aged thymus 17 and/or in the TEC defect-induced atrophied thymus  , we utilized our previously generated mouse model with accelerated thymic atrophy due to postnatal TEC homeostatic defect 12  , in which the loxp-flanked FoxN1 gene FoxN1fx/fx 18 can be deleted by ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein CreERT mediation through either a tamoxifen TM induction or a CreERT autoleakage with age.These preclinical studies indicate that HER4 contributes to ER translocation to target genes and functions as an ER transcriptional co-regulator  , selectively binding with ER to gene promoters harboring ERE. Accordingly  , HER4/4ICD forms a complex with ER and is translocated into the nucleus upon estrogen stimulus  , and the nuclear ER/4ICD complex co-activates ER transcription by being selectively recruited to estrogen responsive gene promoters such as progesterone receptor PgR 14 ,21.In a study following the influence of ERβ on ERα transcription  , a model of estrogen positive T47D cell line containing a tet-off inducible FLAG-ERβ corresponding to the short ERβ1 isoform was used 23. According to the authors  , no oscillatory recruitment was observed for either receptor subtype whose kinetics of recruitment were similar during the time course analyzed.Finally  , while our experimental results were derived largely with aggressive breast cancer cell lines that do not express estrogen or progesterone receptors  , we found that the expression pattern of Tiam1 and OPN in human breast cancer-associated fibroblasts was correlated with invasiveness rather than hormone receptor expression. Our findings using immortalized mammary fibroblasts and specific breast cancer cell lines lay the foundation for studying these questions in broader contexts.The data in Additional data file 4 monitor 3 ,389 genes across 30 estrogen-receptor-negative and 28 estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer samples. 33 ,34.Acting through the progesterone receptor  , progesterone is the physiological negative regulator of estrogen activation 45. Additionally  , binding of estrogen to the ER can be modulated by progesterone 44.CreERT  , ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein; FC  , FoxN1fx/fx/CreERT; FoxN1  , Forkhead box protein N1; FoxN1fx/fx  , loxp-flanked FoxN1 gene; IL-2  , interleukin-2; NF-κB  , Nuclear Factor kappa Beta; RT  , reverse transcribed; PCR  , polymerase chain reaction; tTreg  , thymic regulatory T cell. Underlying data used in the generation of this figure can be found in S1 Data.Compared to the overall population of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the Kiaser Permanente Northern California cancer registry from 200–2009  , this surgical cohort has a higher prevalence of hormone receptor positivity 78% overall vs. 88% here  , particularly among pre-menopausal women's tumors 74% overall vs. 95% here. Although neither estrogen nor progesterone receptor status were significantly associated with RPMM methylation profiles  , large numbers of specific CpG loci had significant methylation associations with these tumor characteristics in locus-by-locus analysis Table S2 and Table S3.For individuals in whom tumor tissue was available for PTEN staining  , upward +1 and downward -1 adjustments were made for the absence or presence of PTEN staining  , respectively. The modified method 17-19 includes upward adjustments for TNBC +4  , estrogen-negative +1  , and high-grade invasive cancers +2  , and downward adjustments for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2-positive -4 or estrogen-receptor positive -1  , lobular -2  , and low-grade noninvasive cancers -2.The modified method 17-19 includes upward adjustments for TNBC +4  , estrogen-negative +1  , and high-grade invasive cancers +2  , and downward adjustments for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2-positive -4 or estrogen-receptor positive -1  , lobular -2  , and low-grade noninvasive cancers -2. In brief  , this system assigns scores depending on the type of cancer and age at diagnosis and developed such that a score of 15 was equivalent to a 10% chance of identifying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.Data on estrogen and progesterone receptor status and ERBB2 expression were obtained from the KPNC Cancer Registry 37. For all breast surgical specimens  , hormone receptor status and ERBB2 expression is routinely determined by IHC at the KPNC regional IHC lab  , and if the IHC staining for ERBB2 expression is equivocal less than 30% strong staining  , but more than 10% weak staining  , by fluorescence in situ hybridization at the KPNC regional cytogenetics lab.According to the ExAC 15 database this mutation is more common in Finland carrier frequency ~1.8% than in other European populations carrier frequency ~0.3%. The mutation was found to be associated with breast cancer with an odds ratio OR of 1.86 95% confidence interval CI 1.26–2.75  , P = 0.0018  , especially among triple-negative breast cancer TNBC; estrogen ER and progesterone PR receptor and HER2 negative cases OR 3.56  , 95% CI 1.81–6.98  , P = 0.0002.When gene expression analysis of MCF7 cells in hormone-depleted medium was performed following transfection with the mutant ESR1 constructs with the highest constitutive activity Y537S  , D538G and S463P/D538G  , the mutants demonstrated a unique and shared gene expression pattern that was distinct from the wild-type receptor. Similar high constitutive activation of ESR1 mutants except S463P with concomitant increase in the transcript levels of estrogen-responsive genes such as GREB1  , MYC  , PGR and TFF1 and reduced  , but retained  , response to anti-estrogens was noted by Toy and coworkers 28.In estrogen-starved MCF-7 cells  , confocal analysis revealed a prevalent nuclear distribution of p53 protein  , which was not modified by any of the treatments. As shown in Figure 5  , treatment of estrogen-deprived MCF-7 cells with CSNO or auranofin  , added separately or in combination  , induced an almost exclusively nuclear localization of ERα  , with a clear reduction of the cytoplasmic levels of the receptor.CD  , cluster of differentiation; CreERT  , ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein; FC  , FoxN1fx/fx/CreERT; FoxN1  , Forkhead box protein N1; FoxN1fx/fx or FoxN1-floxed  , loxp-flanked FoxN1 gene; GFP  , green fluorescent protein; Teff  , T effector cell; tTreg  , thymic regulatory T cell; WT  , wild-type. Underlying data used in the generation of this figure panel B can be found in S1 Data.The structural basis for constitutive activity of other mutant ER proteins is less well understood although biochemical characterization of some of these mutant proteins has been described 36-39. This results in a conformation of the mutant receptor that is similar to the estrogen-bound wild-type receptor and explains its constitutive activity.Despite these improvements  , however  , tumours often relapse due to innate or acquired resistance to the therapeutic insult. This is exemplified by the advent of therapeutic agents targeting estrogen-receptor positive ER+ and HER2-positive HER2+ breast cancers  , which make up approximately 70% of all breast tumours 2 ,3.GraphPad Prism software GraphPad Software  , San Diego  , CA  , USA was used to compare the mean chemokine gene expression scores with a Tukey test to obtain 95% confidence intervals between the molecular subtypes and receptor statuses by immunohistochemistry. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were positive if >1% immunohistochemical IHC staining was noted  , and HER2 status was positive if 3+ by IHC or with a positive ratio by in situ hybridization assay.A total of 6 ,272 BRCA2 carriers from 39 studies Table 2 and 14 countries contributed DNA samples for this project. Only a limited number of cases had detailed information on tumor characteristics e.g.  , estrogen and progesterone receptor status; therefore  , subtype analyses were not performed at this stage.Finally  , to assess the combined discriminatory ability of texture analysis in CC and MLO views  , Tan et al. Furthermore  , preliminary comparisons of the parenchymal patterns of estrogen-receptor positive ER+ and negative ER– cancer cases measured with the same methodology 51 showed that subtype-specific breast cancer risk assessment based on mammographic textures may also be feasible 79.Our TMA analyses of human breast carcinomas showed that a high ER stress marker BiP levels were associated with higher PrP levels  , b both BiP and PrP levels were higher in grade 3 tumors compared to grade 1 tumors  , and c levels of PrP correlate with estrogen and progesterone receptor negative tumors. Lastly  , we describe that the ER stress-mediated increase in PrP levels is associated with increased cellular survival in human breast cancers.Additionally  , binding of estrogen to the ER can be modulated by progesterone 44. The ER can regulate gene transcription either directly or indirectly and  , depending on the patterns of co-regulator recruitment to the ligand–receptor–gene assembly  , can elicit either the stimulation or inhibition of specific biological effects 43.On the contrary  , the impairment of SNO homeostasis increased the presence of this receptor in the nuclear fraction from these cells Figure 6. As shown in Figure 6  , treatment with auranofin and/or CSNO decreased the levels of cytosolic ERα  , compared with control cells  , where the absence of the estrogen signal induced higher levels of stabilized cytosolic ERα protein.Sirt1 transcription factor has been shown to regulate Hey2  , a downstream effecter of Notch1 signaling 38 ,39  , one of the more prominent activated pathways in the luminal-restricted mammary progenitor cells 40 ,41. Ncoa4 nuclear receptor co-activator 4 and FOXA1 forkhead-box A1  , both have been shown to act as transcriptional activators of estrogen ER-α 36 ,37.Here evidence is presented that the progesterone metabolites  , 5α-pregnane-3 ,20-dione 5α-dihydroprogesterone; 5αP and 4-pregnen-3α-ol-20-one 3α-dihydroprogesterone; 3αHP  , can regulate ER/PR-negative breast cell tumor formation and growth as well as tumor regression and maintenance of normalcy. Overall  , this means that for receptor-negative breast cancers  , current explanations based on estrogen and progesterone actions and receptors are inadequate  , and the related hormone-based therapies are ineffective.Furthermore  , the Ki-67 index of 10 false-negative patiets was under 14%. In the 17 false-negative patients  , 15 had >50% estrogen-receptor-positive cells  , and 13 also had >20% progesterone-receptor-positive cells in primary tumors.Genomic amplification of BAF57/SMARCE1  , a core subunit of human SWI/SNF complexes that plays a role in interaction with transcription factors and chromatin  , has been linked to high risk of recurrence of estrogen/progesterone receptor-negative breast tumors 12. In this study  , we demonstrated that SMARCE1 plays a key role in breast cancer metastasis by protecting breast cancer cells against anoikis through the HIF1A/PTK2 pathway.Tamoxifen or estrogen withdrawal block this effect and increase the dependence of breast cancer cells on Notch signalling 10. Moreover  , it has previously been shown  , in this system  , that estradiol inhibits Notch activity by altering Notch receptor cellular localization.As it concerns the pesticide atrazine  , it exerted estrogenic effects without binding to ERs 61 and exhibiting the capability to activate the GPER-mediated pathway despite a low binding affinity for this receptor 25 ,27. For instance  , the phytoestrogen genistein and the xenoestrogen bisphenol A  , which exert estrogen-like activities binding to and activating ERα 9 ,59  , displayed the ability to bind to and activate GPER signaling 9 ,27 ,60.Our analysis of publicly available cDNA arrays from Gruvberger et al. The data monitor 3 ,389 genes across 30 estrogen-receptor-negative and 28 estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer samplesMost of the human breast cancer samples we studied had at least some expression of ER and/or PR  , consistent with the pattern of breast cancers seen in clinical practice. Finally  , while our experimental results were derived largely with aggressive breast cancer cell lines that do not express estrogen or progesterone receptors  , we found that the expression pattern of Tiam1 and OPN in human breast cancer-associated fibroblasts was correlated with invasiveness rather than hormone receptor expression.Correlations were done with Spearman's rank correlation in InStat. Correlation between averaged estrogen I and progesterone J receptor levels in cores ERS/PR positive = 1 and ERS/PR negative = 0 correlated with PrP scores.Overall  , this means that for receptor-negative breast cancers  , current explanations based on estrogen and progesterone actions and receptors are inadequate  , and the related hormone-based therapies are ineffective. Patients with receptor-negative tumors generally show lack of response to adjuvant hormone therapy and have significantly higher risk of mortality compared with patients with tumors that are ER and/or PR positive 10-14.This cell line  , derived from a ductal breast carcinoma  , is estrogen negative  , progesterone receptor negative and ERBB2 positive  , and has been particularly well studied at the molecular level 2 ,7 ,23. Here  , we have applied comprehensive sequence-based approaches using exome capture and transcriptome sequencing in a breast cancer cell line  , HCC1954  , to identify potential cancer-specific and somatically driven LOH and ASE events  , and to discern their functional characteristics.To determine whether the absence of nuclear colocalisation between TFF1 and GREB1 was an exception or a more general feature of estrogen induced transcription  , we analysed the positioning of the progesterone receptor PGR and Cathepsin-D CTSD genes  , both located on different regions of chromosome 11. Using qRT-PCR  , we confirmed that PGR and CTSD expression was activated upon addition of E2 to MCF-7 cells Figure 4B with relative mRNA levels increasing 3 and 8 fold  , respectively  , after 16 h exposure to 10 nM E2.Not only do these "receptor-negative" breast cancers fail to benefit from current hormonal therapies  , but they also generally exhibit more-aggressive biologic behaviors and poorer prognosis than the receptor-positive ones 10-14. However  , a large percentage of breast tumors are ER and/or PR negative 4 ,6-8 and therefore are not explained by the actions of estrogen and/or progesterone.Cx47 was shown to interact with the tight junction adaptor protein zonula occludens 1 ZO-1  , the Y-box transcription factor zonula occludens 1 associated nucleic acid binding protein ZONAB which regulates expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA  , cyclin D1 and ErbB-2. Besides loss of channel function  , loss of intracellular protein interaction may also be relevant for the phenotype of Cx47M282T expressing mice and for PMLD.The early discovery 8 of a transmembrane receptor able to mediate estrogen responsiveness in ER-negative breast cancer cells was then confirmed by several reports by which GPER was considered as a genuine ER 10 ,19. Since its identification to date  , the transduction signaling and gene expression profile triggered by GPER have been extensively characterized.Consistent with a predicted induction of DNA damage  , doxorubicin-treated organotypic cultures exhibited high levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX γH2AX  , a cellular marker of double-strand DNA breaks DSB Figure

1.For tumor grade  , receptor status  , and histological type  , the only significant difference reported in the randomized trials was that women treated with estrogen alone were more likely to have lobular tumors than ductal tumors. In the Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trials 2 ,30  , women treated with estrogen alone or treated with estrogen–progestin had slightly larger tumors and a higher prevalence of lymph node involvement than untreated women.Other tissues exhibit one or two exclusive TFs for example: midgut  , Estrogen-receptor related and Adult enhancer factor-1; head epidermis  , PvuII-PstI homology 13; yolk  , Cryptocephal. The largest uniform group retained in this analysis is a set of 12 TFs expressed exclusively in the central brain and the ventral nerve cord for example  , Sox102F and a few previously uncharacterized factors  , and the second largest comprises 5 TFs in the trunk musculature and related mesodermal structures for example  , Lame duck.aP-value generated by univariate Cox analysis. DEFS  , distant event-free survival; MKS  , mitotic kinase score; ERS  , estrogen-related score; GGI  , genomic grade index; Lum  , luminal; ER+/HER2-lowP  , ER-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2-negative low proliferation; ER+/HER2-highP  , ER-positive/HER2-negative high proliferation; NA  , not applicable.For this purpose the regression model is usually adjusted for age  , pT stage  , grading  , hormone estrogen and progesterone receptor as well as ERBB2 status 38. To understand whether TXNRD1 and TXNIP are independent of conventional clinical parameters  , we performed a multivariate Cox analysis Table 3.Risk assessment is of utmost importance because of the well-known side effects of adjuvant treatment and is being conducted by means of TNM classification and differentiation grade complemented by estrogen and progesterone receptor status  , Her2neu expression and peritumoral vascular invasion 2-6. Adjuvant treatments are only indicated if they significantly reduce the risk for recurrence.A recent single-institution study showed that 50% of high-risk patients with TNBC had mutations in BRCA1/2  , but notably  , 76% of this cohort had a family history of breast cancer 10. The results in this study are consistent with that in other cohorts of triple-negative breast cancer patients  , in whom 11% to 39% have germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 3 ,6 ,20-23  , and cohorts of estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer patients  , of whom 24% to 29% have germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 4 ,6 ,24 ,25.Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to assess potential confounding effects of other breast cancer prognostic factors  , including age  , stage with nodal status  , and estrogen and progesterone receptor status. Both heterozygotes and homozygotes were assessed separately in relation to the referent.Data analyses of three publically available breast cancer mRNA microarray databases 52-54 revealed that higher PrP mRNA levels were significantly associated with lower estrogen ERS and progesterone PR receptor levels and higher tumor grades Table 1. Together  , these results indicate that high PrP mRNA levels are associated with poorer prognosis breast cancers.Briefly  , FoxN1fx/fx 18 mice were crossbred with CMV-promoter-driven CreERT ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein Tg mice  , then with rag-gfp reporter mice. Various genetically manipulated mouse colonies all on C57BL/6 genetic background and their crossbreeding schemes have been described in our previous publication 14.Tumor size was measured in a uniform manner by participating study pathologists. Data on estrogen and progesterone receptor status and ERBB2 expression were obtained from the KPNC Cancer Registry 37.Several studies demonstrated that acquired resistance to drugs that block ER signalling is the consequence of activation of alternative survival signalling via growth factor receptors  , such as epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and human epidermal growth factor 2 HER2  , that enable ERα + ve breast cancer cells to escape anti-estrogen actions and contribute to an invasive phenotype 5 ,6. Consistent with clinical outcomes  , quantitative proteomic analysis of acquired tamoxifen resistance cells confirmed signatures associated with an increased migratory capacity 4.We chose to limit our candidate gene pool to minimize the risk of false-positive results. Furthermore  , CYP2D6*4  , which was included to account for the possible differential effect of variable tamoxifen metabolism on outcome among patients whose tumors were estrogen-receptor positive  , was included in all the models tested  , and there was no independent effect of this genotype  , nor did it appear to confound the main effects.Given the modification of ER activity by its cofactors through their physical and functional interactions 16  , the cofactor proteins that bind to ER may be as important as the receptor itself in mediating transcriptional response to estrogen exposure 17. To assess this hypothesis  , we investigated the association of common genetic variation  , using a tagging SNP approach  , within 60 cofactor genes in two large case-control samples of breast cancer from Sweden and Finland  , and investigated their interaction with genetic variation within ESR1 in terms of influencing the risk of hormone-driven breast cancer.A and B The curves are nonlinear one-phase decay; the results demonstrated that absolute cell numbers of tTreg cells were not reduced with age  , while the numbers of tTcon cells were dramatically reduced with age. CreERT  , ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein; FoxN1fx/fx  , loxp-flanked FoxN1 gene; Tcon  , conventional T cell; tTcon  , thymic conventional T cell; tTreg  , thymic regulatory T cell.The strong stimulation of ERα 171% increase and ERβ 120% increase gene expression and the protein regulation of a large number of non-estrogen-responsive genes caused by 17β-HSD1 overexpression further suggest that the ligand-independent transcriptions of ER target genes are also modulated by the enzyme. The concept of pre-receptor regulation of E2 action by 17β-HSD1 corroborates with its effect on the modulation of E2 responsiveness of pS2 genes in T47D cells 11  , since E2 exerts its biological effect on breast cancer predominantly via the mediation of ERα and ERβ 23 ,24.These data therefore suggest that the ERα receptor is involved in the augmented proliferation of MCF-7 cells with impaired SNO homeostasis. Significantly  , cyclin D1 plays an important role in the progression through the cell cycle induced by estrogen and ER 29.Interestingly  , as shown in Figure 4  , treatment of MCF-7 cells with the selective estrogen-receptor modulator SERM tamoxifen caused repression of Hes-6  , indicating that Hes-6 might work as a marker for tamoxifen response in breast cancer cells. However  , the role of ERβ in Hes-6 regulation is not known and must be clarified in future studies.Among five previous epidemiological studies that examined the effect of alcohol consumption according to ER/PR status among young women 19 ,36 or premenopausal women 12 ,22 ,37  , two found a 10 to 38% increase in risk of ER+PR+ cancer  , which was not statistically significant  , for women at the highest category of alcohol consumption versus women who had never drunk alcohol 22 ,37; one found an increase in risk of the ER+PR- subtype 36; and another found a non-statistically significant increase in risk of both ER+PR+ and ER- PR- receptor subtypes 19. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that alcohol exerts its effect on the premenopausal breast via estrogen.In order to understand the role of TXNRD1 and TXNIP  , we determined their relation to these three coordinates according to Freis and colleagues 37. In recent years  , the genome-wide search for markers predicting prognosis in breast cancer has led to a global picture in which three coordinates representing important biological processes have outstanding prognostic consequences 31 ,35 ,36: the proliferation metagene  , consisting of a group of genes indicating transition from slow to fast proliferation; the B-cell and T-cell metagenes as markers for immune cell infiltration; and estrogen-receptor-dependent genes.Metaphase FISH indicated that both alleles of these genes reside on normal-looking chromosomes 11 in MCF-7 cells Figure 4A. To determine whether the absence of nuclear colocalisation between TFF1 and GREB1 was an exception or a more general feature of estrogen induced transcription  , we analysed the positioning of the progesterone receptor PGR and Cathepsin-D CTSD genes  , both located on different regions of chromosome 11.These structural OFT defects are presaged by the complete absence of detectable Semaphorin 3c Sema3c expression in Twist1;Wnt1-Cre CKO cNCCs Figure S6. In addition to the formation of ectopic OFT sympathetic-like neurons  , Twist1;Wnt1-Cre CKOs also display completely penetrant persistent truncus arteriosus PTA; Figure S5G  , S5K; Table S1.Tamoxifen  , a selective estrogen-receptor modulator  , is an important therapeutic agent for patients with ER-positive breast cancers 26. However  , little has been explored regarding the hormone-independent effect of tamoxifen in breast cancer cells.The following clinical data were included: age  , menopausal status  , tumor stage on basis of pTNM classification  , estrogen/progesterone receptor ER/PR status  , Her2Neu receptor status  , differential grade of the tumor based on the Bloom-Richardson method  , adjuvant treatment  , date of recurrence if occurred  , location of recurrence local versus distant  , date of breast cancer-associated death or non-breast cancer-associated death. Two databases were created  , one with the results of the CTC analysis  , patient ID and inclusion date and one with the clinical data from the patient charts; both were merged at the time of the analysis at the hospital.The final multivariate-adjusted models shown include those factors that either changed the estimated effect by 10% or more in a best-fitting model  , which was developed by starting with a full model and then excluding covariates that did not improve the overall fit. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to assess potential confounding effects of other breast cancer prognostic factors  , including age  , stage with nodal status  , and estrogen and progesterone receptor status.In this regard  , the opposing actions of the progesterone metabolites also appear to exert some control over the estrogen-regulated effects on breast cancer by their ability to modulate ER numbers in ER-positive cells 43. Because in vitro studies have shown that both ER- and/or PR-negative and -positive breast cells respond in a stimulatory and inhibitory fashion  , respectively  , to 5αP and 3αHP  , and have 5αPR and 3αHPR  , the present results also may have implications for the substantial numbers 20% to 40% of ER/PR-positive patients who fail to respond to suppression of estrogen and/or progesterone levels or actions 4 ,41 ,42  , as well as for those receptor-positive tumors that do respond to hormonal therapies.The estrogen  , progesterone  , and HER2 receptor status of the samples were classified by TCC pathologists using College of American Pathologists CAP criteria and obtained from the TCC database. Prediction analysis of microarray 50 PAM50 was used to classify breast cancer molecular subtypes within the TCC dataset 11.AIs work by abrogating the activity of the enzyme aromatase Cyp 19  , which converts circulating androgens into estrogen within different body compartments including mammary adipose tissue 2–4. One of the major advances in breast cancer therapy in the past decade has been the widespread endorsement of aromatase inhibitors AIs as first-line therapy for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.The discrepancy between these results and those from observational studies is puzzling. For tumor grade  , receptor status  , and histological type  , the only significant difference reported in the randomized trials was that women treated with estrogen alone were more likely to have lobular tumors than ductal tumors.aOnly patients with known clinical information were considered for comparison between tamoxifen-treated cohort 1 and untreated patients. N  , number of patients; MKS  , mitotic kinase score; ERS  , estrogen-related score; HER2: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2.Breast cancer detection methods were recorded at time of diagnosis from the chart notes and were the following: 1 patient detected: lump or abnormality discovered by the patient symptomatic; 2 physician detected: lump or abnormality discovered during routine physical examination symptomatic; or 3 mammography detected: lump or breast abnormality discovered by a non-diagnostic mammogram. We defined hormone receptor positive patients as estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive HR positive and HR-negative if negative for both.Furthermore  , preliminary comparisons of the parenchymal patterns of estrogen-receptor positive ER+ and negative ER– cancer cases measured with the same methodology 51 showed that subtype-specific breast cancer risk assessment based on mammographic textures may also be feasible 79. The authors showed a collective discriminatory capacity of AUC = 0.85  , with the fractal dimension  , run-length  , co-occurrence  , and gray-level histogram features being more frequently selected than local binary and edge-enhancing index features in classification models.Therefore  , our study demonstrated that overexpression of the tldD gene could increase PQQ level by 12.30 % in G. oxydans ZJU5 compared with that of G. oxydans ZJU4 Table 2. In other PQQ-producing bacteria  , the peptidase-like protein PqqF is required for PQQ synthesis and has a similar function as the TldD in G. oxydans 32.The domain architecture of the ER includes an N-terminal hormone-independent transactivation domain AF1  , a highly conserved DNA-binding domain that mediates specific recognition of ERE  , a hinge domain that separates the DNA-binding domain from the ligand-binding domain LBD  , a LBD that contains the hormone binding pocket  , and a second transactivation domain AF2 in the C-terminus that is activated in response to ligand binding 7. The binding of ligand induces a conformational change in the receptor  , which translocates to the nucleus  , binds as a homodimer to specific DNA sequences termed estrogen response elements ERE and regulates the transcription of multiple target genes.Because in vitro studies have shown that both ER- and/or PR-negative and -positive breast cells respond in a stimulatory and inhibitory fashion  , respectively  , to 5αP and 3αHP  , and have 5αPR and 3αHPR  , the present results also may have implications for the substantial numbers 20% to 40% of ER/PR-positive patients who fail to respond to suppression of estrogen and/or progesterone levels or actions 4 ,41 ,42  , as well as for those receptor-positive tumors that do respond to hormonal therapies. Furthermore  , because both tumorigenic and normal nontumorigenic breast cells respond to the opposing actions of 5αP and 3αHP  , the relative concentrations of the progesterone metabolites in the microenvironment may also play a role in maintaining normalcy of breast tissues in general  , regardless of ER/PR status.The antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen  , by competing with estrogen for binding to the ER in tumor tissue  , is considered to be its core mechanism of action  , and adjuvant use of tamoxifen after primary resection of ER-positive breast tumor decreases the risk of recurrence 27. Tamoxifen  , a selective estrogen-receptor modulator  , is an important therapeutic agent for patients with ER-positive breast cancers 26.This results in a conformation of the mutant receptor that is similar to the estrogen-bound wild-type receptor and explains its constitutive activity. It has been postulated that the Gly538–Asp531 hydrogen bond was enabled by the flexibility of glycine residue owing to its small size  , which allows it to adopt backbone conformations that are not accessible for other amino acids.Accordingly  , HER4/4ICD forms a complex with ER and is translocated into the nucleus upon estrogen stimulus  , and the nuclear ER/4ICD complex co-activates ER transcription by being selectively recruited to estrogen responsive gene promoters such as progesterone receptor PgR 14 ,21. HER4/4ICD possesses constitutively active kinase activity and is a chaperone for nuclear entry of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A STAT5A.Since their discovery  , microRNAs have been implicated in many steps of cancer development and progression. The Croce group has shown that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in human breast cancers and that this expression correlated to multiple features of cancer  , including estrogen and progesterone receptor status  , stage  , and indices of proliferation and invasion 7.In this scenario  , it has been recently demonstrated that GPER acts as an additional receptor mediating the effects of estrogens in a wide number of cell types  , such as breast  , endometrial and ovarian cancer cells 7. Moreover  , the existence of alternative ERs able to mediate estrogen signaling without exhibiting any sensitivity to the repressive action of the ER antagonists could be also involved in the resistance to endocrine agents.Over the past decade  , it has become evident that BC represents a heterogeneous disease  , for which different subtypes can be distinguished based on the combination of tumor grade and the presence of hormone receptors  , i.e.  , estrogen ER  , progesterone PR and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 HER2. Worldwide  , breast cancer BC is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and leading cause of female cancer death 1.The experiments of ESR1 gene silencing confirmed that the expression of ERα is required for moderate nitrosative stress to increase the proliferative capacity of breast cancer cells. The impairment of the Trx/TrxR system has thus been described to increase the progesterone receptor expression in MCF-7 cells in response to estrogen 30.A matching control cell line  , HCC1954BL  , which was established from lymphoblast cells of the same patient  , was studied in parallel. This cell line  , derived from a ductal breast carcinoma  , is estrogen negative  , progesterone receptor negative and ERBB2 positive  , and has been particularly well studied at the molecular level 2 ,7 ,23.The index thus designed was applied to a breast cancer dataset that included both DNA copy number and mRNA expression data  , showing that inferred JARID1b activity was prognostic for estrogen-receptor-positive disease. The detailed multilevel alterations induced by JARID1b were analyzed in a pathway-specific manner to develop a diagnostic test.It is well known that risk of breast cancer is linked with endogenous estrogen and progesterone exposure  , including early menarche  , late menopause  , nulliparity  , age at first birth 21–25  , as well as exogenous exposure to hormone replacement 26. Breast cancer overall shows a bimodal distribution with respect to age  , with the first peak occurring at age 50 years more commonly medullary or inflammatory breast cancer  , and the second peak reached at over 70 years of age more commonly estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive lobular or mucinous cancers 20.The impairment of the Trx/TrxR system has thus been described to increase the progesterone receptor expression in MCF-7 cells in response to estrogen 30. Other studies have shown association between Trx/TrxR and the estrogen response in human breast cancer cells.CD  , cluster of differentiation; cKO  , conditional knockout; CreERT  , ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein; DP  , double positive; FC  , FoxN1fx/fx/CreERT; FF  , FoxN1fx/fx without CreERT for controls; Foxn1  , Forkhead box protein N1; FoxN1fx/fx  , loxp-flanked FoxN1 gene; mOVA-Tg  , membrane-bound ovalbumin transgenic mouse; OT-II  , MHC class-II restricted ovalbumin-specific TCR transgenic mouse; RQ-MFI  , relative quantitative Mean Fluorescence Intensity; WT  , wild-type.

Limited to the early stage  , 7 patients 19.4% were diagnosed as non-cancer.However  , the latter gene also highlights the general difficulty of such analysis. Other tissues exhibit one or two exclusive TFs for example: midgut  , Estrogen-receptor related and Adult enhancer factor-1; head epidermis  , PvuII-PstI homology 13; yolk  , Cryptocephal.Doxorubicin treatment did not alter the hormone receptor status of ex vivo breast tumors  , including estrogen and progesterone receptors Figure S1A and B in Additional file

1A.We therefore hypothesized that genetic variation within ER cofactor genes may alter cellular response to estrogen exposure and consequently  , alone or by interacting with genetic variations within ESR1  , modify breast cancer risk in an ER status-dependent fashion. Given the modification of ER activity by its cofactors through their physical and functional interactions 16  , the cofactor proteins that bind to ER may be as important as the receptor itself in mediating transcriptional response to estrogen exposure 17.CreERT  , ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein; FoxN1fx/fx  , loxp-flanked FoxN1 gene; Tcon  , conventional T cell; tTcon  , thymic conventional T cell; tTreg  , thymic regulatory T cell. Underlying data used in the generation of panels A and B can be found in S1 Data.Of note  , genotyping for CYP2D6*4 was included to account for any possible differential effect of variable tamoxifen metabolism on outcome among patients whose tumors were estrogen-receptor positive. All variants were hypothesized to result in decreased enzyme function 10.Supporting these results  , analysis of the mRNA microarray data 52-54 indicated that in two of three studies  , high-BiP expressing tumors were associated with higher PrP mRNA levels Table 2. In contrast  , no significant correlation was observed between the levels of BiP and the estrogen and progesterone receptor status.Several epidemiological studies have examined this hypothesis by ER and PR status separately or jointly 15-17  , and a review from 2004 17 concluded that early age at menarche  , nulliparity  , and delayed childbearing were associated with an increased risk for receptor-positive breast cancer  , but not with receptor-negative breast cancer. Furthermore  , it has been hypothesized that hormone-related risk factors that reflect exposure to estrogen and progesterone may be predominantly associated with breast tumors that express ER and PR  , but not with those lacking ER and PR expression 8-14.The TldD protein of G. oxydans 621H  , related to the E. coli TldD  , is a peptidase involved in processing of small peptides. Notably  , it was reported that disruption of tldD gene in G. oxydans led to a drop of PQQ excretion below the detection limit and a decrease in cell growth  , indicating that the related tldD gene was essential for PQQ biosynthesis 32.CD  , cluster of differentiation; CreERT  , ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein; FC  , FoxN1fx/fx/CreERT; FF  , FoxN1fx/fx without CreERT for controls; Foxn1  , Forkhead box protein N1; FoxN1fx/fx or FoxN1-floxed  , loxp-flanked FoxN1 gene; i.p.  , intraperitoneally; i.t.  , intrathymically; mOVA  , membrane-bound ovalbumin; NS  , not significant; TCR  , T cell receptor; Tg  , transgenic; TM  , tamoxifen; tTcon  , thymic conventional T cell; tTreg  , thymic regulatory T cell.

Bag-1 also has anti-apoptotic effects that are independent of Bcl-2; it binds to multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and enhances their ability to inhibit apoptosis 44  , and it interacts with the heat shock proteins HSC70 and HSP70 45.Three different mutants of PCNA that disrupt

48 ,49.Each BC subtype  , including the luminal A-like  , luminal B-like  , luminal HER2-like  , HER2-like and triple negative breast cancer TNBC  , presents with different age and risk factor distributions 2. Over the past decade  , it has become evident that BC represents a heterogeneous disease  , for which different subtypes can be distinguished based on the combination of tumor grade and the presence of hormone receptors  , i.e.  , estrogen ER  , progesterone PR and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 HER2.DEFS  , distant event-free survival; MKS  , mitotic kinase score; ERS  , estrogen-related score; GGI  , genomic grade index; Lum  , luminal; ER+/HER2-lowP  , ER-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2-negative low proliferation; ER+/HER2-highP  , ER-positive/HER2-negative high proliferation; NA  , not applicable. P-values in boldface were statistically significant at P<0.05.We selected 15 SNPs CYP2B6*4  , CYP2B6*5  , CYP2B6*6  , CYP2B6*7  , CYP2B6*9  , CYP2C9*2  , CYP2C9*3  , CYP3A4*1B  , CYP3A5*3  , CYP3A5*6  , CYP2D6*4  , GSTM1  , GSTT1  , GSTP1*B  , GSTP1*C in eight genes for inclusion by first identifying cyclophosphamide-metabolizing enzyme polymorphisms that were associated with functional effects on enzyme expression  , levels or activity  , then excluding those in which the expected prevalence of the combination of alleles for a particular gene was ≤ 10% of the general population  , since these constituted a minute fraction of cyclophosphamide metabolism and significant effects for these SNPs were unlikely to be detectable with the sample size available. Of note  , genotyping for CYP2D6*4 was included to account for any possible differential effect of variable tamoxifen metabolism on outcome among patients whose tumors were estrogen-receptor positive.CreERT  , ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein; FC  , FoxN1fx/fx/CreERT; FF  , FoxN1fx/fx without CreERT for controls; Foxn1  , Forkhead box protein N1; FoxN1fx/fx  , loxp-flanked FoxN1 gene; GFP  , green fluorescent protein; Tcon  , conventional T cell; TM  , tamoxifen; tTcon  , thymic conventional T cell; tTreg  , thymic regulatory T cell.

Underlying data used in the generation of this figure can be found in S1 Data.Additional data file 2 is based on a dataset from a publicly available lung cancer study of Bhattacharjee et al. The data in Additional data file 4 monitor 3 ,389 genes across 30 estrogen-receptor-negative and 28 estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer samples.Given the multitude of interacting partners of RXRs over 19 described 40  , dissecting the mechanism of RXR action on the promoter of AQP5 and other genes will require a very detailed examination. However  , evaluation of stringently predicted RXR binding sites in the AQP5 promoter in human and rat shows that the presence of adjacent predicted RAR binding sites is rare or absent  , while adjacent predicted VDR sites are more common  , and predicted estrogen and glucocorticoid receptor sites also abut RXR binding site 56.In addition  , it is possible that repression of Hes-6 could be important for the breast cancer-suppressive effects of tamoxifen. Interestingly  , as shown in Figure 4  , treatment of MCF-7 cells with the selective estrogen-receptor modulator SERM tamoxifen caused repression of Hes-6  , indicating that Hes-6 might work as a marker for tamoxifen response in breast cancer cells.Not surprisingly  , molecular classification and current prognostic signatures mainly reflect these molecular features 2. The most profound effects on gene expression profiles in breast cancer are related to estrogen ER  , and proliferation status  , and to a lesser extent to Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 HER2 status.The mechanisms by which steroid hormones stimulate mammary epithelium growth are controversial and continue to be the source of intense investigation. Acting through the progesterone receptor  , progesterone is the physiological negative regulator of estrogen activation 45.Furthermore  , CYP2D6*4  , which was included to account for the possible differential effect of variable tamoxifen metabolism on outcome among patients whose tumors were estrogen-receptor positive  , was included in all the models tested  , and there was no independent effect of this genotype  , nor did it appear to confound the main effects. There was no significant effect of CYP2B6 genotype seen in patients on the standard arm CAF alone  , in the absence of thiotepa  , which would have been expected if the thiotepa was ameliorating a true effect of genotype.A A schematic workflow shows that young FF-mOVA-Tg normal thymus or FC-mOVA-Tg atrophied thymus mice were i.t.

In contrast  , it could be hypothesized that hormonal factors should affect receptor-positive and receptor-negative breast cancer similarly.The results in this study are consistent with that in other cohorts of triple-negative breast cancer patients  , in whom 11% to 39% have germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 3 ,6 ,20-23  , and cohorts of estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer patients  , of whom 24% to 29% have germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 4 ,6 ,24 ,25. For all of these series and for our study  , BRCA1 mutations are more common than BRCA2 mutations.To determine whether the capacity of newly generated tTreg cells is impaired in aged thymus 17 and/or in the TEC defect-induced atrophied thymus  , we utilized our previously generated mouse model with accelerated thymic atrophy due to postnatal TEC homeostatic defect 12  , in which the loxp-flanked FoxN1 gene FoxN1fx/fx 18 can be deleted by ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein CreERT mediation through either a tamoxifen TM induction or a CreERT autoleakage with age. Together  , these results suggest that the severity of thymic atrophy positively influences new tTreg cell generation and negatively affects pTreg cells reentering the thymus.N  , number of patients; MKS  , mitotic kinase score; ERS  , estrogen-related score; HER2: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. 21.The Croce group has shown that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in human breast cancers and that this expression correlated to multiple features of cancer  , including estrogen and progesterone receptor status  , stage  , and indices of proliferation and invasion 7. They have shown potential roles as predictors of treatment outcomes and microRNA profiling of tumors may have the ability to predict prognosis and identify tumor subtypes 5.The FoxN1fx/fx cKO was through either a TM-induced acute deletion or CreERT autoleakage-mediated time-course deletion 12. Briefly  , FoxN1fx/fx 18 mice were crossbred with CMV-promoter-driven CreERT ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein Tg mice  , then with rag-gfp reporter mice.A cell-type-specific functional understanding of molecular alterations will be increasingly important to improve the success of molecular assays in clinical decision-making. The index thus designed was applied to a breast cancer dataset that included both DNA copy number and mRNA expression data  , showing that inferred JARID1b activity was prognostic for estrogen-receptor-positive disease.In recent years  , the genome-wide search for markers predicting prognosis in breast cancer has led to a global picture in which three coordinates representing important biological processes have outstanding prognostic consequences 31 ,35 ,36: the proliferation metagene  , consisting of a group of genes indicating transition from slow to fast proliferation; the B-cell and T-cell metagenes as markers for immune cell infiltration; and estrogen-receptor-dependent genes. TXNIP showed also a weakly positive correlation with the B-cell metagene R = 0.278; P < 0.001.HRs of death calculated from a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model for patients diagnosed with estrogen-positive tumors who underwent breast-conserving surgery. PR Progesterone receptorEstrogen and progesterone receptors were positive if >1% immunohistochemical IHC staining was noted  , and HER2 status was positive if 3+ by IHC or with a positive ratio by in situ hybridization assay. The estrogen  , progesterone  , and HER2 receptor status of the samples were classified by TCC pathologists using College of American Pathologists CAP criteria and obtained from the TCC database.Only a limited number of cases had detailed information on tumor characteristics e.g.  , estrogen and progesterone receptor status; therefore  , subtype analyses were not performed at this stage. Data were available on age at study recruitment  , age at cancer diagnosis  , age of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy  , BRCA1/2 mutation description  , and self-reported ethnicity.However  , evaluation of stringently predicted RXR binding sites in the AQP5 promoter in human and rat shows that the presence of adjacent predicted RAR binding sites is rare or absent  , while adjacent predicted VDR sites are more common  , and predicted estrogen and glucocorticoid receptor sites also abut RXR binding site 56. Thus  , it is possible that RXR effects are mediated through interactions with RAR.To directly address the role of fork-associated chromatin proteins in histone
spreading at replication  , we examined mutations of PCNA and Chromatin Assembly
Factor CAF-1  , which plays a key role in replication-coupled histone deposition
48 ,49. Unfortunately  , both hir and
asf1 mutants are lethal in our strain background likely
because our strain carries only one copy of the H3/H4 gene pair 51  , preventing
us from testing this hypothesis.This subtype is therefore similar to the apocrine subclass  , recently proposed 24 ,25  , which is characterized by over-expression of AR and genes that are either direct targets of ER or responsive to estrogen 24 ,25. One group was characterized by over-expression of ERBB2  , the steroid hormone receptor AR  , and genes related to steroid estrogen response such as GATA3  , TFF1  , and DNALI1.  , prior hormonal therapy status  , prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy status  , de novo disease status  , race  , estrogen/progesterone receptor status  , and selected biomarkers. Other pre-specified subanalyses were carried out according to ECOG performance status  , baseline metastatic sites liver  , lung  , bone  , etc.These studies have shown that Tyr537 hydrogen bonds with Asn348 in the wild-type receptor  , resulting in stabilization of the backbone of the helix 11–12 loop and leaving Leu536 in a solvent-exposed position. These structural studies also support the notion that ESR1 mutations probably arose in response to an estrogen-deprived state rather than anti-estrogen therapy 22.
