The only gene that scored positive in our screen at high stringency in all four cell lines is alpha-actinin 4 ACTN4. A number of studies have directly or indirectly implicated the BCL2 family as regulators of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells 33 ,66-71.In controls  , β-catenin–Venus was detected in a restricted territory covering approximately half of the embryo from the 16- to 32-cell stage onwards  , with a sharp boundary developing by the mid-blastula stage Figure 3A  , as reported in Nematostella with Xenopus and Nematostella β-catenin–GFP fusion proteins 9. To assess Wnt pathway activation we injected eggs before fertilisation with RNA encoding a Podocoryne β-catenin–Venus fusion protein see Materials and Methods.In fission yeast  , Cdk9 has been implicated in mRNA 5′-end formation  , through its role in recruiting a capping enzyme to transcribed chromatin 87. H2Bub1 has been linked to various aspects of RNA processing in budding yeast and in mammalian cells  , including splicing  , 3′ end formation  , and nuclear export 30  , 57  , 84–86.Still to be determined are the full range of H2Bub1-dependent functions that depend on P-TEFb activity and the mechanisms by which H2Bub1 and Cdk9 influence each other. In fission yeast  , Cdk9 has been implicated in mRNA 5′-end formation  , through its role in recruiting a capping enzyme to transcribed chromatin 87.ACTN4 is a cytoskeletal protein that has been found to interact with signaling molecules  , chromatin-remodeling factors  , and transcription factors reviewed in 65. The only gene that scored positive in our screen at high stringency in all four cell lines is alpha-actinin 4 ACTN4.
