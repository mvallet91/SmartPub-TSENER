Both branches are widely distributed across the three cellular domains Figure 2. In contrast  , the other two branches  , interconnected through 5 ,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate  , involve either the glycine-cleavage system or serine hydroxymethyltransferase EC:2.1.2.1.For comparisons  , we used our cross-linking data to construct a model by selecting an alignment to the glycophorin A TM homodimer NMR structure Mac-Kenzie et al. 2002.With respect to hGATA-1s  , the Epo-R minimal erythroid pEpoR and the GATA-1 IE3.9int promoters were activated at a lower level approximately 50%  , whereas the erythroid porphobilinogene deaminase promoter was not activated  , and both the glycophorin-B −95GpB and the synthetic 3XGATA-TK promoters were equally transactivated. No difference in the transcriptional activity of hGATA-1 and hGATA-1Rb− was detected with these promoters.In contrast  , the other two branches  , interconnected through 5 ,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate  , involve either the glycine-cleavage system or serine hydroxymethyltransferase EC:2.1.2.1. Two of them  , involving the degradation of L-threonine Figure 1  , are partially distributed in Bacteria and Eukarya Figure 2.Models for clusters 11 and 12 were kindly provided by the authors of Gottschalk et al. The alignment where αIIb sequence W968/VLVG and β3 sequence V696/LLSV were aligned with glycophorin A sequence G79/VMAG in each monomer gave the lowest root mean square distance 4.8 Å and thus was chosen as the final model.To assess the respective transcriptional activities of hGATA-1  , hGATA-1Rb−  , and hGATA-1s  , we performed transient transfection assays in NIH-3T3 cells using a luciferase reporter gene driven by several minimal erythroid-specific promoters that included 1 the erythroid porphobilinogene deaminase promoter nucleotides −714 to +78 PBGD 42  , 2 the glycophorin-B promoter −95GpB 43  , 3 the erythropoietin receptor promoter −58  , +43 Epo-R 44  , 4 the 3XGATA-TK synthetic promoter 45  , and 5 the GATA-1 proximal promoter IE together with its upstream enhancer element IE3.9int 46. hGATA-1 and hGATA-1Rb

proteins have undistinguishable transcriptional activity.These different plasmids were cotransfected with the “empty” Migr plasmid or with Migr-derived plasmids expressing hGATA-1  , hGATA-1Rb−  , or hGATA-1s. To assess the respective transcriptional activities of hGATA-1  , hGATA-1Rb−  , and hGATA-1s  , we performed transient transfection assays in NIH-3T3 cells using a luciferase reporter gene driven by several minimal erythroid-specific promoters that included 1 the erythroid porphobilinogene deaminase promoter nucleotides −714 to +78 PBGD 42  , 2 the glycophorin-B promoter −95GpB 43  , 3 the erythropoietin receptor promoter −58  , +43 Epo-R 44  , 4 the 3XGATA-TK synthetic promoter 45  , and 5 the GATA-1 proximal promoter IE together with its upstream enhancer element IE3.9int 46.7a  , P. infestans can also generate serine using the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase  , SHMT E.C. As shown in Fig.Top proteins enriched in the old TEC included cytoskeleton organization proteins calponin 1  , palladin  , collagens COL3A1  , COL4A2  , COL12A1 and transforming growth factor beta-induced protein TGFBI Fig. 3  , Table 1.Apart from calponin 1  , other actin-binding molecules such caldesmon 1  , cortactin and palladin were also identified. High abundance of calponin 1 in old tenocyte TEC may be related to changes in ECM content that affect mechanical properties of the engineered tissue and increase mechanical strain detected by the cells.Transgelin  , cytoskeletal protein previously referred to as cellular biomarker of ageing 55  , demonstrated less than two-fold difference in abundance between young and old TEC. Apart from calponin 1  , other actin-binding molecules such caldesmon 1  , cortactin and palladin were also identified.1997 that minimized the distances between residues with more than 80% cross-linking efficiency see Materials and Methods. For comparisons  , we used our cross-linking data to construct a model by selecting an alignment to the glycophorin A TM homodimer NMR structure Mac-Kenzie et al.hGATA-1 and hGATA-1Rb

For each model  , the average Cβ–Cβ or Cβ–Gly Cα atom distance between residues that formed disulfides at greater than 80% efficiency Trp968–Val696  , Val969–Val696  , Val971–Leu697  , Gly972–Leu697  , and Gly972–Val700 was calculated.Consistent with this  , studies on dimerization of the glycophorin A TM domains have shown that cysteine substitutions are on average less disrupting than substitutions with any other hydrophobic residue Lemmon et al. Furthermore  , none of the ten β3 or 12 αIIb single-cysteine mutants studied here showed elevated ligand binding activity data not shown.Since glycophorin A TM domains dimerize in lipid and detergent micelles Lemmon et al. 2001 or lipid bilayers  , and association between the TM domains has never been demonstrated in intact cells.1992 under conditions similar to those under which integrin TM domains fail to heterodimerize  , it has been proposed that the interaction between the integrin TM domains is less stable Gottschalk et al.
