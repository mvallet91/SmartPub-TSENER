These results suggest that hApis_5AT is able to produce O-antigen  , which could be a TA-like O-antigen  , as already identified in several Gram-negative bacteria Jann et al. 2003; and 4 HDEF_2072  , which contains a rfaL-like O-antigen ligase domain.Venom kallikreins generally possess a catalytic triad and 10 to 12 conserved cysteine residues 31 ,33 ,34. Kallikrein-like proteases are also present in shrew 30 ,31  , lizard 32 and some snake venoms 28.2003; and 4 HDEF_2072  , which contains a rfaL-like O-antigen ligase domain. In hApis_5AT  , we identified putative candidates for these four genes: 1 HDEF_0181  , which possesses a weak similarity to the wzx flippase; 2 HDEF_0195  , homolog of wzy; 3 fepE HDEF_0537  , which has a role analogous to wzz in Salmonella typhimurium Murray et al.
