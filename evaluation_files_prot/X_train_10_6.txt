The number of DEGs detected following mating 331 from control-mated females plus 80 new DEGs from lure-mated females were substantially greater than the 32 transcripts reported in C. capitata Gomulski et al. In addition to the already reported immune genes  , sperm proteins  , and testis expressed genes  , our study has revealed expression of several titin like muscle proteins and histone proteins and we elaborate on these below.These changes were reflected at the protein level as determined by immunostaining of non-invasive IT lesions and broadly invasive IC2 lesions. We identified several components of desmosomes – Dsp  , Dsg2  , desmocollin 2 Dsc2; MGI: 103221  , and plakophilin 2 Pkp2; MGI: 1914701 – whose expression was significantly downregulated in the highly invasive tumor lesions that develop in the RT2 mouse model of PNET.Since K+ can freely diffuse from the basolateral fluid of the hair cells to the perilymph in the scala tympani  , it may seem surprising that the K+ concentration was only marginally elevated in the scala tympani of claudin-9 mutant mice. This insulation is likely to be impaired in the nmf329 mice because: 1 the nmf329 mutation eliminated the K+ barrier function of claudin-9  , 2 the timing of hair-cell degeneration in the nmf329 mice coincided with the development of EP  , 3 the OHCs of claudin-9 mutant mice did not degenerate ex vivo under normal culture conditions  , and 4 the OHCs of claudin-9 mutant mice were rescued from degeneration by a second gene defect that reduces the K+-driving force in the cochlea.In addition to genes encoding chorion and titin proteins  , DEGs in lure-mated females comprised testis expressed proteins  , sperm proteins  , and a different set of histone proteins fig. The DEGs were dissimilar to that of control-mated females  , with 67 new up-regulated transcripts identified.Briefly  , 4 μm sections were deparaffinised in xylene for 30 minutes and rehydrated using graded ethanol concentrations. The antibodies used  , vendors  , clones  , retrieval methods and dilutions were as follows: matrix metalloproteinase 9 MMP9 Vector Laboratories  , Burlingame  , CA  , USA  , VP-M6444  , clone 2C3  , microwave retrieval in citrate buffer  , 1:40 dilution  , matrix metalloproteinase 2 MMP2 Labvision  , Fremont  , CA  , USA Catalog #RB-9233-P0; microwave retrieval in citrate buffer  , 1:50 dilution and claudin 4 Zymed Laboratories  , San Francisco  , USA  , Clone 3E2C1  , steam in citrate buffer  , 1:100 dilution.We observed that 8 out of the 14 candidate genes tested exhibited a specific expression in the otic vesicle region  , with at least partially overlapping expression with either the pax8 or pax2 gene during otic development compare Figure 3a and 3b; Additional data file 3: coiled-coil domain-containing protein 102A ccdc102a  , meteorin-like protein precursor mtrnl  , sec31-like isoform 1 sec31l  , claudin-7 cldn7  , brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 2 brn2/pou3f2 Figure 3b  , claudin-4 cldn4  , ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 2 iba2 and brain mitochondrial carrier protein-1 bmcp1 Additional data file 3. One candidate  , XTP3-transactivated gene B protein precursor erlectin  , exhibited a weaker expression pattern in the otic vesicle Additional data file 3 when compared to the former eight strongly and specifically expressed genes.Exclusively enriched or suppressed genes in lure-mated females and taxa-specific transcripts suggest complex factors  , additional to male Acps and sperm  , contribute to female post-mating behaviors. Transcripts such as those encoding titin-like muscle proteins  , histone proteins and a number of unknown genes in mated females suggest their possible role in mediating post-mating changes and warrants further research on female-specific genetic changes.H-zones are always straight and evenly spaced. In wild type myofibrils  , obscurin and kettin  , a titin isoform  , label in straight bands at M-lines and Z-discs  , respectively.Up-regulated functional genes included titin like muscle proteins  , chorion proteins  , Nesprin1  , replicase polyprotein  , and H3 acetylation. There were 69 DEGs found in both lure-mated and control-mated females with 47 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated transcripts.We recorded several other transcripts up-regulated after mating that are unique to this study  , including titin-like proteins and histone proteins. Since there was no previous record in insects  , it is also possible that titin encode differential functions unlike in humans.Similarly  , many ER− breast cancer cell lines are known to reflect the claudin-low  , mesenchymal subtype of breast tumor  , which is very rare in vivo 20. This might reflect the fact that the majority of breast cancer cell lines were established from advanced cancers and thus luminal cell lines would be expected to be equivalent to luminal B tumors which express cluster 1 RER regions rather than less aggressive luminal A tumors which express cluster 2 RER regions.Interestingly  , four kinases were identified hexokinase 1 HK1  , hexokinase 2 HK2  , pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cells PKLR  , and phosphofructose kinase liver PKFL  , which regulate irreversible steps of the glycolysis pathway Figure 3. Of the group of kinases that were identified as hits  , the majority of them are serine/threonine kinases 33 of 83  , whereas fewer belonged to the tyrosine kinase 10 of 83  , lipid kinase four of 83  , or sugar/metabolism kinase 12 of 83 families.demonstrated a contribution of Neuropilin-2 NRP2  , a vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF co-receptor  , to GLI1 levels in claudin-low cell lines 40. Recently  , Goel et al.Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting are as follows: rabbit anti-Perp 20 1:200  , mouse anti-desmoplakin clone 115F 1:500  , mouse anti-desmoglein 1/2 clone 4B2 1:1 ,000  , chicken anti-plakoglobin 1408 1:5 ,000  , mouse anti-desmocollin 2 Abcam  , Cambridge  , MA  , USA; 1:5 ,000  , mouse anti-β actin peroxidase conjugate Sigma Chemical Corp.; 1:1 ,000  , mouse anti-GAPDH Fitzgerald Laboratories  , Acton  , MA  , USA; 1:15 ,000. Equal amounts of total protein for each sample were subjected to Western blot analysis using standard protocols.These mutations either introduce a premature stop codon 19  , 20 or affect alternative splicing of the >100-kb-long messenger RNA 21. The most common genetic cause of DCM are truncating mutations in the gene encoding Titin TTN  , a giant sarcomeric protein that spans from the A-band to the Z-disc of the sarcomere 17  , 18.Claudin 3  , 5 and actin gene espression were also upregulated by the exposure to laminar shear stress thus strongly suggesting that acting as a key regulator of TJ expression. Our study shows that exposure to flow increases the RNA levels of genes encoding for a variety of tight junctional proteins see Figure 1A including the intracellular scaffold proteins Zonula occludens-1 ZO1 and 2 ZO-2 which link the junctional molecules claudin and occludin to intracellular actin and the cytoskeleton.In addition to the already reported immune genes  , sperm proteins  , and testis expressed genes  , our study has revealed expression of several titin like muscle proteins and histone proteins and we elaborate on these below. Despite the methodological differences  , the additional unique transcripts recorded in B. tryoni can help understand the female factors possibly mediating the post-mating changes.Our study added another well-defined TN cohort to the scientific community. We identified three subtypes of TN patients: 1 non-basal-like 22%; 2 basal-like with LIR and high M2-like macrophages 45%; and 3 basal-enriched  , including claudin-low subtypes  , with HIR and low M2-like macrophages 33%.Other treatments can decrease the level of barrier function. The isolated SBS barrier function was found to be relatively unchanged in regards to claudin-1  , claudin-2 and claudin-4 with a decrease in occludin expression when compared to sham group 51.The results showed that the genes including glucose transporter 3 GLUT3  , hexokinase 1 HK1  , phosphoglycerate kinase 2 PGK2  , pyruvate kinase M PKM  , and lactate dehydrogenase A LDHA were induced by hypoxia and knockdown of TET1 or INSIG1 abolished or decreased their expression levels in two different cell lines Figure 4a ,b  , and Additional file 11a ,b. The genes in the glucose metabolism pathway were tested for their expression under hypoxia and knockdown of TET1 or INSIG1.Claudin-low tumor cells are enriched for characteristics of tumor-initiating cells and across a differentiation spectrum are most similar to mammary epithelial stem cells 5. There are conflicting reports as to the prevalence of these tumors  , ranging from as low as 1.5% of tumors 2 to 5 to 14% of breast tumors 3-5.Our results indicate that multiple members of Zasp PDZ domain proteins may be required to provide the critical mass for Z body assembly. Recently  , a comparative evolutionary study showed that only four ortholog groups localize to Z-discs in all bilaterian species: Zasp  , α-actinin  , titin  , and MLP proteins  , suggesting that these four protein groups could be sufficient for assembly and function of Z-discs 52.Recently  , a comparative evolutionary study showed that only four ortholog groups localize to Z-discs in all bilaterian species: Zasp  , α-actinin  , titin  , and MLP proteins  , suggesting that these four protein groups could be sufficient for assembly and function of Z-discs 52. Together with the well-documented role of ZASP mutations in human disease  , our data indicate that these proteins occupy a central place in muscle assembly and function.We identified several components of desmosomes – Dsp  , Dsg2  , desmocollin 2 Dsc2; MGI: 103221  , and plakophilin 2 Pkp2; MGI: 1914701 – whose expression was significantly downregulated in the highly invasive tumor lesions that develop in the RT2 mouse model of PNET. Our results clearly demonstrate that the conditional genetic deletion of a single core desmosomal component  , Dsp  , promotes increased local tumor invasion in RT2 mice  , producing a phenocopy of such inferred transcriptional regulation in the normal circumstances of tumor progression.Titin =connectin was not reported previously either in Drosophila or tephritids  , although a few muscle related proteins were differentially expressed in Ostrinia nubilalis Al-Wathiqui et al. We recorded several other transcripts up-regulated after mating that are unique to this study  , including titin-like proteins and histone proteins.The myosin heavy chain locus represents a well characterized example of transcriptional regulation of both protein-coding 25 and noncoding DCM-associated genes 26. Titin transcript processing is controlled by the DCM-associated splicing factor RBM20 21–24  , which targets a number of additional DCM-associated genes.Claudin 4 was noted to be down regulated in the LCIS SAGE library compared with the five pooled normal libraries using the DGED program  , and underexpressed compared with all other libraries derived from benign and malignant breast epithelium using the Digital Northern function Figure 2. Claudins are tight junction proteins that are aberrantly expressed in several human cancers 28-30.The translucent supernatant was then supplemented with 2 mM GTP  , 10 pM taxol  , 1 U/ml hexokinase  , 50 mM glucose  , and 25–50 nm AMP-PNP and incubated on ice for 90 min for microtubule polymerization. The supernatant was centrifuged at 150 ,000xg for 60 min and the pellet discarded.Titin transcript processing is controlled by the DCM-associated splicing factor RBM20 21–24  , which targets a number of additional DCM-associated genes. These mutations either introduce a premature stop codon 19  , 20 or affect alternative splicing of the >100-kb-long messenger RNA 21.Antibodies used were rabbit anti-Claudin-4 Abcam  , Cambridge  , UK  , Ref 1504  , mouse anti-CD-10 Abcam  , Ref. For immunofluorescent detection of protein markers under a fluorescence microscope  , cells were plated into chamber slides  , fixed with paraformaldehyde 4 % for 10 minutes permeabilized for 15 minutes in 1 × PBS 0.5 % Triton X100 solution  , rinsed twice with 1 × PBS and  , blocked in PBS 0.1 % Tween20 2 % fetal calf serum for 1 h at room temperature.Extracts were prepared from 0- to 1-  , 1- to 2- and 2- to 3-hour old wild-type and smaug-mutant embryos and assayed for A hexokinase activity or B phosphofructokinase activity. Glycolytic enzymes are overexpressed in -mutant embryos.The isolated SBS barrier function was found to be relatively unchanged in regards to claudin-1  , claudin-2 and claudin-4 with a decrease in occludin expression when compared to sham group 51. Expression of cldn1 Claudin 1  , 7.4 log2 FC  , cldn2 7.0 log2 FC  , cldn7b 2.4 log2 FC and cldn11a 2.3 log2 FC were all increased  , as were several of the integrins.In these experiments  , the cells were seeded on Transwell filters  , and the main salt component of the assay buffer was diluted 2-fold on one side of the MDCK monolayer  , while osmolarity was maintained by adding mannitol. To characterize the ion permeability profile of both wild-type and mutant claudin-9  , we performed dilution-potential assays in Ussing chambers  , using the stable clones of claudin-9 and claudin-9transfected Tet-off MDCK cells.Secondary antibodies included HRP goat anti-mouse 1:5 ,000  , HRP goat anti-chicken 1:5 ,000  , HRP goat anti-rabbit 1:5 ,000; Jackson Immunoresearch  , West Grove  , PA  , USA. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting are as follows: rabbit anti-Perp 20 1:200  , mouse anti-desmoplakin clone 115F 1:500  , mouse anti-desmoglein 1/2 clone 4B2 1:1 ,000  , chicken anti-plakoglobin 1408 1:5 ,000  , mouse anti-desmocollin 2 Abcam  , Cambridge  , MA  , USA; 1:5 ,000  , mouse anti-β actin peroxidase conjugate Sigma Chemical Corp.; 1:1 ,000  , mouse anti-GAPDH Fitzgerald Laboratories  , Acton  , MA  , USA; 1:15 ,000.Microtubule polymers were sedimented through 20% sucrose cushion made in PMEG with10 pM taxol by centrifugation at 20 ,000xg for 90 min. The translucent supernatant was then supplemented with 2 mM GTP  , 10 pM taxol  , 1 U/ml hexokinase  , 50 mM glucose  , and 25–50 nm AMP-PNP and incubated on ice for 90 min for microtubule polymerization.To elucidate the global functions of Smaug in early embryos we employed two genome-wide approaches: 1 RNA co-immunoprecipitations followed by microarray analysis RIP-Chip to identify mRNAs that are bound by Smaug and 2 polysome gradients coupled to microarrays to identify targets of Smaug-mediated translational repression. We present data indicating that Smaug regulates the expression of mRNAs encoding glycolytic enzymes hexokinase and phosophofructokinase  , a proteasome regulatory subunit Rpn7 as well as epigenetic Suz12 and post-transcriptional Bicaudal C regulators.In wild type myofibrils  , obscurin and kettin  , a titin isoform  , label in straight bands at M-lines and Z-discs  , respectively. We next analyzed adult IFM of iZasp52ex20 and Dcr iZasp52ex16 mutants by antibody staining and confocal microscopy Figure 3C.Therefore  , we examined a series of well-characterised cases of LCIS for claudin 4 expression by immunohistochemistry. Claudin 4 was noted to be down regulated in the LCIS SAGE library compared with the five pooled normal libraries using the DGED program  , and underexpressed compared with all other libraries derived from benign and malignant breast epithelium using the Digital Northern function Figure 2.Our study shows that exposure to flow increases the RNA levels of genes encoding for a variety of tight junctional proteins see Figure 1A including the intracellular scaffold proteins Zonula occludens-1 ZO1 and 2 ZO-2 which link the junctional molecules claudin and occludin to intracellular actin and the cytoskeleton. Tight junction protein complexes provide a mechanical means to seal the paracellular pathways between adjacent endothelial cells 8 ,24.The antibodies used  , vendors  , clones  , retrieval methods and dilutions were as follows: matrix metalloproteinase 9 MMP9 Vector Laboratories  , Burlingame  , CA  , USA  , VP-M6444  , clone 2C3  , microwave retrieval in citrate buffer  , 1:40 dilution  , matrix metalloproteinase 2 MMP2 Labvision  , Fremont  , CA  , USA Catalog #RB-9233-P0; microwave retrieval in citrate buffer  , 1:50 dilution and claudin 4 Zymed Laboratories  , San Francisco  , USA  , Clone 3E2C1  , steam in citrate buffer  , 1:100 dilution. Immunohistochemical labelling was performed using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex technique and 3' ,3'-diaminobenzidine as chromagen.For example  , several genes involved in cancer-associated glycolysis and lipogenesis Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha Acaca  , ATP citrate lyase Acly  , and Hexokinase 2 Hk2 are upregulated in the mammary tissue of socially isolated mice 24. One of the greatest advantages of using mouse models to study BC is the ability to isolate specific cellular components within the tumor microenvironment.A non-canonical mechanism was implicated  , since SMO knockdown did not interfere with the process. demonstrated a contribution of Neuropilin-2 NRP2  , a vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF co-receptor  , to GLI1 levels in claudin-low cell lines 40.Polycomb repressive complex 2 PRC2 trimethylates histone H3 on lysine 27  , a mark that is associated with transcriptional silencing 60. Likewise  , because of enrichment for the GO term ‘glucose metabolic process’ and the KEGG pathway ‘glycolysis/gluconeogenesis’  , we assayed hexokinase  , the first enzyme in glycolysis  , and phosphofructokinase  , which represents a critical point of regulation 58 ,59 and catalyzes the committed step of glycolysis that is  , the product of this reaction serves solely as a precursor to the final product of the glycolytic pathway.In the more strongly associated height locus the associated SNPs lead SNP rs1751138  , joint  , i.e.  , discovery and replication combined  , P-value = 3.03×10−10  , MAF = 0.36 are located approximately 35 kb upstream of ITM2A integral membrane protein 2A  , a gene implicated in early cartilage development 13  , 14. The lead SNP maps to an apparent gene desert: the gene closest to the association  , SLC6A14  , a possible candidate gene for X-linked obesity OMIM: 300444  , lies more than 500 kb away.Alox12  , Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase; Casp6  , Caspase 6; Matn2  , Matrilin 2; Ptplb  , Protein tyrosine phosphatase-like B; Sox21  , SRY sex determining region Y-box 21; Spock2  , Sparc/osteonectin  , CWCV  , and Kazal-like domains proteoglycan testican 2; Tesc  , Tescalcin; Tpm2  , Tropomysin 2; Wif1  , WNT inhibitory factor; Stmn1  , stathmin 1; Ptp4a2  , phosphatase 4a2. All nine patterns detected in the microarray set were validated by the qRT-PCR results.For example  , digestive enzymes GO:0004252  , serine-type endopeptidase activity  , P < 0.01; GO:0006508  , proteolysis  , P < 0.01 and glucose metabolism enzymes GO: 0004396  , hexokinase activity  , P < 0.01; GO:0006096  , glycolysis  , P < 0.05 appeared to have undergone significant gene family expansions in the ground tit. We identified 203 gene families that were substantially expanded in the ground tit compared with other birds Table 2; Additional file 1  , Figure S7.The “tightness” of tight junctions varies greatly from tissue to tissue  , and depends largely on the presence of integral membrane proteins known as claudins 6. The claudin C-terminus binds to scaffolding proteins such as zonula occludens-1  , -2  , -3 and MUPP-1  , which link the tight junction to the actin cytoskeleton 13–17.Transcripts such as those encoding titin-like muscle proteins  , histone proteins and a number of unknown genes in mated females suggest their possible role in mediating post-mating changes and warrants further research on female-specific genetic changes. This study presents a wide range of functional transcripts differentially regulated in mated females.EYFP-claudin-9- and EYFP-claudin-9-transfected stable clones of Tet-off MDCK II cells were seeded onto Transwell inserts 9×104 cells/cm2 and incubated in medium with or without doxycycline 100 ng/ml for 8 days. These four buffers differed only in their main salt component  , as indicated by their names 140 mM NaCl  , 140 mM NaAsp  , 140 mM ArgCl  , and 140 mM KCl; the other components were identical in every buffer 2 mM CaCl2  , 1 mM MgCl2  , 10 mM glucose  , 5 mM Tris  , pH was adjusted to 7.3 with HCl.This insulation is likely to be impaired in the nmf329 mice because: 1 the nmf329 mutation eliminated the K+ barrier function of claudin-9  , 2 the timing of hair-cell degeneration in the nmf329 mice coincided with the development of EP  , 3 the OHCs of claudin-9 mutant mice did not degenerate ex vivo under normal culture conditions  , and 4 the OHCs of claudin-9 mutant mice were rescued from degeneration by a second gene defect that reduces the K+-driving force in the cochlea. Therefore  , the basolateral fluid of hair cells must be insulated from the K+-rich apical milieu.TNBCs also include the Claudin-low molecular subtype 3  , which is characterized by greatly reduced expression of intercellular junction components and by activation of molecular pathways associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition EMT  , cancer stem cells  , and the immune response 4. However  , they are not completely synonymous 1  , 2.Indeed  , while claudin-low tumors express more GLI1 than the basal  , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 Her2  , and luminal B subtypes overall  , there still existed heterogeneity within this subset Figure 2D. This association fits with our data indicating transcriptional regulation of GLI1 by NFκB  , and speaks to the molecular heterogeneity of the claudin-low subclass.This inappropriate regulation of Dsc2 might contribute to desmosome dysregulation. As expected  , the expression level of desmocollin-2 Dsc2  , one of the ubiquitous desmosomal components 44  , is high in the mutant uterus Figure 6K.Note the intact labelling of residual luminal epithelium and diminished expression in LCIS cells which undermine the luminal epithelium. d Claudin 4 IHC of LCIS case 2.Several studies have previously found that inhibition of glycolysis enhances TRAIL-induced cell death 46-49. Interestingly  , four kinases were identified hexokinase 1 HK1  , hexokinase 2 HK2  , pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cells PKLR  , and phosphofructose kinase liver PKFL  , which regulate irreversible steps of the glycolysis pathway Figure 3.We observed that the minor A allele of rs1751138  , which is associated with shorter stature  , is also associated with an increased expression of ITM2A in whole blood P-value = 6.23×10−14  , N = 513; Materials and Methods  , providing further evidence for ITM2A as a functional candidate gene for this association. In the more strongly associated height locus the associated SNPs lead SNP rs1751138  , joint  , i.e.  , discovery and replication combined  , P-value = 3.03×10−10  , MAF = 0.36 are located approximately 35 kb upstream of ITM2A integral membrane protein 2A  , a gene implicated in early cartilage development 13  , 14.Thus  , C3 was claudin-low enriched but this subtype only represented a quarter of its number. The distribution was: 0% in C1  , 2% 1/48 in C2 and 26% 9/35 in C3.It contains a protein kinase domain positioned to sense mechanical load and it is found that the kinase domain interacts with the zinc-finger proteins to respond to mechanical stimuli in humans Lange et al. Titin is found primarily in skeletal muscles and is involved in sarcomere related functions Greaser 2001.Among the functional transcripts up-regulated  , immune response transcripts were highly enriched followed by genes encoding chorion proteins  , transposable elements  , titin-like muscle proteins and histone proteins fig. Three-hundred and thirty-one genes were differentially expressed DEGs 254 up-regulated and 77 down-regulated in control-mated females when compared with virgin females supplementary tables S1 and S2  , Supplementary Material online.Furthermore  , the social modulation of these glycolytic and lipogenic pathways is amplified in mammary adipocytes relative to non-adipocyte cell populations 57. For example  , several genes involved in cancer-associated glycolysis and lipogenesis Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha Acaca  , ATP citrate lyase Acly  , and Hexokinase 2 Hk2 are upregulated in the mammary tissue of socially isolated mice 24.Titin is found primarily in skeletal muscles and is involved in sarcomere related functions Greaser 2001. 2014.The claudin C-terminus binds to scaffolding proteins such as zonula occludens-1  , -2  , -3 and MUPP-1  , which link the tight junction to the actin cytoskeleton 13–17. The second extracellular loop is thought to be important for the intercellular claudin-claudin interactions 12.Down-regulated genes included adult cuticle protein  , genome polyprotein  , zinc finger protein  , and chitin binding protein. Up-regulated functional genes included titin like muscle proteins  , chorion proteins  , Nesprin1  , replicase polyprotein  , and H3 acetylation.In both studies  , labeling decreased thereafter but remained about 10% almost to the end of pregnancy  , consistent with the continued increase in both claudin 7 and keratin mRNA up to day P18. The rapid increase between the virgin gland and pregnancy day 5 is consistent with studies showing a peak of thymidine incorporation between days 2 and 5 of pregnancy  , when about 25% of the cells were labeled 14 ,15.It is interesting to note here that bmcp1 is described as expressed in the otic vesicle neither in GXD nor in ZFIN gene expression pattern databases  , whereas it has been reported in the literature only to be localized in rat and mouse inner ears 40. We observed that 8 out of the 14 candidate genes tested exhibited a specific expression in the otic vesicle region  , with at least partially overlapping expression with either the pax8 or pax2 gene during otic development compare Figure 3a and 3b; Additional data file 3: coiled-coil domain-containing protein 102A ccdc102a  , meteorin-like protein precursor mtrnl  , sec31-like isoform 1 sec31l  , claudin-7 cldn7  , brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 2 brn2/pou3f2 Figure 3b  , claudin-4 cldn4  , ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 2 iba2 and brain mitochondrial carrier protein-1 bmcp1 Additional data file 3.Since there was no previous record in insects  , it is also possible that titin encode differential functions unlike in humans. 2014b  , perhaps those proteins were activated to hold the male weight.
