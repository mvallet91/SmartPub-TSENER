To quench endogenous peroxidase  , the sections were treated with 0.3% v/v hydrogen peroxide  , and then blocked with 3% goat serum for 30 min  , followed by incubation with rabbit anti smooth muscle α-actin Abcam; 1∶500 or rabbit anti-calponin 1 Millipore; 1∶200 at 4°C overnight. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the sections in 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 20 min.After primary antibody incubation  , the sections were washed and sequentially incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and ABC reagent Vector Labs. To quench endogenous peroxidase  , the sections were treated with 0.3% v/v hydrogen peroxide  , and then blocked with 3% goat serum for 30 min  , followed by incubation with rabbit anti smooth muscle α-actin Abcam; 1∶500 or rabbit anti-calponin 1 Millipore; 1∶200 at 4°C overnight.Top proteins enriched in the old TEC included cytoskeleton organization proteins calponin 1  , palladin  , collagens COL3A1  , COL4A2  , COL12A1 and transforming growth factor beta-induced protein TGFBI Fig. 3  , Table 1.We validated the interaction between NINLisoB and MICAL3 by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations Fig 6b and confirmed that endogenously expressed MICAL3 is present at the photoreceptor connecting cilium in rat retina P20  , partially overlapping with the cilium and basal body marker polyglutamylated tubulin Fig 7b–7d’. An additional relevant NINL interaction partner identified was MICAL3 Microtubule-associated Monooxygenase  , Calponin and LIM domain containing 3 protein  , which is known to participate in a protein complex with RAB6 and RAB8 that is involved in the fusion of exocytotic vesicles 39  , a process that appears to be deficient in the retina of cc2d2a mutants and ninl morphants.After endogenous peroxidase blocking 3% w/v H2O2  , sections were pre-incubated in blocking solution 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C at 1/100 dilution with calponin antibody ab46794  , Abcam  , UK. Tendon constructs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h  , longitudinally embedded in paraffin and cut into 4 μm thick sections on poly-L-lysine-coated slide.Sections were washed in phosphate buffered saline PBS three times before being incubated in Ztyochem Plus HRP Polymer anti-rabbit ZUC032  , Source Bioscience  , UK for 1 h at room temperature. After endogenous peroxidase blocking 3% w/v H2O2  , sections were pre-incubated in blocking solution 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C at 1/100 dilution with calponin antibody ab46794  , Abcam  , UK.
