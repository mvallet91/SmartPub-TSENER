Statins induce expression of genes encoding enzymes of sterol and nonsterol biosynthesis pathways. CAT5– ubiquinone biosynthesis monooxygenase  , COQ3 – 3 ,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoate-O-methyltransferase  , COQ2 – para-hydroxybenzoate-polyprenyl transferase  , BTS1 – geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase  , RER2 – cis-prenyltransferase  , SEC59 – dolichol kinase.Eumetazoan Cryptochrome genes originated from three ancestral genes in the last common Bilateria ancestor  , namely Cry1/2/3  , Cry4/5  , and Cry6. Overall  , the number of cryptochrome genes among species varies considerably.Prior to the two vertebrate specific WGDs we found species with no cryptochrome Ciona intestinalis  , leech  , some mites  , one scorpions and some insects  , two some mites and insects  , or three crys cephalochordates  , echinodermates  , mollusks  , spiders  , and some insects. 1A  , B and 2.Cryptochrome 6 was likely lost at the basis of the Chordate evolution  , which explains the appearance of Cry6 in Echinodermata and various Protostomia but its absence in Tunicates and Cephalochordates. Eumetazoan Cryptochrome genes originated from three ancestral genes in the last common Bilateria ancestor  , namely Cry1/2/3  , Cry4/5  , and Cry6.33 demonstrated that 32 repressive histone effector domains could be conditionally targeted to a genomic locus via the light sensitive cryptochrome 2 CRY2 protein and its interacting partner CIB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana 33. Konermann et al.Circadian clocks in mammalian tissues generate molecular circadian rhythms through coupled transcription/translation feedback loops in which the positive gene elements Clock and Bmal1 interact with the negative gene elements Period Per 1 and 2  , and Cryptochrome Cry 1 and 2  , and in which casein kinases  , CKIɛ and CKIδ  , set circadian period by phosphorylating PER proteins to regulate their degradation and nuclear localization 38 ,40. However  , it is unclear from these in vivo studies whether circadian rhythms of retinal gene expression are self-sustained or driven by the master SCN clock.It has been proposed that other CRY2 alleles affect flowering in a wide range of accessions  , but experimental data supporting this suggestion are still lacking 15. Similarly  , the EDI EARLY DAY-LENGTH INSENSITIVE allele of the photoreceptor CRY2 CRYPTOCHROME 2 causes early flowering under short days  , but appears to be restricted to accessions from the Cape Verde Islands 14.Based on our phylogeny  , we hypothesize that in ancestral Bilateria three Cryptochromes Cry1/2/3  , Cry4/5  , and Cry6 built the basis for all currently known family members. The investigation of cry sequences from a variety of over 100 Bilateria led us to draw a comprehensive picture of Cryptochrome evolutionary history and to gain new insight into possible evolutionary events in the different invertebrate and vertebrate lineages.We found a huge variability in cryptochrome number and identity throughout the different animal phyla. 2.This makes them an interesting lineage to study Cryptochrome evolution and phylogeny. 2.Similarly  , the EDI EARLY DAY-LENGTH INSENSITIVE allele of the photoreceptor CRY2 CRYPTOCHROME 2 causes early flowering under short days  , but appears to be restricted to accessions from the Cape Verde Islands 14. A naturally occurring deletion in FLM  , which causes early flowering in both long and short days 12  , has so far only been found in accessions from Niederzenz 13.CAT5– ubiquinone biosynthesis monooxygenase  , COQ3 – 3 ,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoate-O-methyltransferase  , COQ2 – para-hydroxybenzoate-polyprenyl transferase  , BTS1 – geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase  , RER2 – cis-prenyltransferase  , SEC59 – dolichol kinase. B Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of genes from ubiquinone and dolichol synthesis and protein prenylation pathways.Multiple studies indicate the role of EGR family TFs in learning and synaptic function 47 ,62  , and recent work showed that EGR1 directly regulates GABA receptor subunits in the hippocampus 63. A number of observations support the role of EGRs in ASD etiology: a as reported earlier  , EGR1 displays an excess of de novo mutations S20 Fig 50; b variants disrupting EGR binding sites in the Contactin-associated protein-like 2 CNTNAP2 promoter were reported as risk factors for ASD 58; c MECP2  , in which mutations cause Rett syndrome 29 ,59  , was found to be regulated by EGR2 in a positive feedback loop 60; d compared to controls  , EGR2 expression is significantly lower in Rett syndrome and ASD brain samples 60  , as well as in ASD lymphoblastoid cells 61.Next  , we checked the effects of statins on the expression of genes encoding yeast cis-prenyltransferase Rer2p and dolichol kinase Sec59p. Furthermore  , dolichol plays a role in the regulation of angiogenesis during tumor growth 24.This particular study was not focused on identifying the epigenetic properties of the chromatin modifiers  , but this technique holds potential as a toolkit that can provide high temporal resolution with which to study epigenetic mechanisms and identify epigenetic factors 114. 33 demonstrated that 32 repressive histone effector domains could be conditionally targeted to a genomic locus via the light sensitive cryptochrome 2 CRY2 protein and its interacting partner CIB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana 33.WGD events and subsequent loss of some paralogous genes in the vertebrate lineage have shaped the Cryptochrome family in each vertebrate lineage. Based on our phylogeny  , we hypothesize that in ancestral Bilateria three Cryptochromes Cry1/2/3  , Cry4/5  , and Cry6 built the basis for all currently known family members.In our study statins generally reduced expression of RER2 and SEC59 genes  , which suggests that the dolichol synthesis could be decreased in statin-treated cells. Next  , we checked the effects of statins on the expression of genes encoding yeast cis-prenyltransferase Rer2p and dolichol kinase Sec59p.ERG10 – acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase  , ERG13 – 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase  , human HMGR and yeast HMG1  , HMG2 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Co A reductase 1 and 2  , FPP1 – farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase  , ERG1 – squalene monooxygenase  , ERG6 – delta24-sterol C-methyltransferase  , ERG3 – C-5 sterol desaturase  , COQ3 – 3 ,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoatemethyltransferase  , COQ2 – para-hydroxybenzoate-polyprenyl transferase  , CAT5 – ubiquinone biosynthesis monooxygenase  , BTS1 – geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase  , RER2 – cis-prenyltransferase  , SEC59 – dolichol kinase.

Circadian clocks in mammalian tissues generate molecular circadian rhythms through coupled transcription/translation feedback loops in which the positive gene elements Clock and Bmal1 interact with the negative gene elements Period Per 1 and 2  , and Cryptochrome Cry 1 and 2  , and in which casein kinases  , CKIɛ and CKIδ  , set circadian period by phosphorylating PER proteins to regulate their degradation and nuclear localization 38 ,40.In addition  , blue light promotes CO expression by stabilizing the FLAVIN-binding KELCH DOMAIN F BOX PROTEIN1 FKF1-GI protein complex 9  , 10.
