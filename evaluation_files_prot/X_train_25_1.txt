Recently  , ExoS was shown to ADP-ribosylate diverse molecules including cyclophilin A and Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin ERM proteins 31 ,32. ADP-ribosylation of Ras at arginine 41 blocks the interaction of Ras with its guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF  , resulting in the inactivation of the Ras signal transduction pathway in the infected host cell 30.Sparcl1 is the only gene we have identified that is enriched in the ganglion cell layer and has a polymorphism that results in a non-conservative amino acid change an R to Q at position 384  , near the junction of the acidic N-terminal domain and the Follistatin like domain 38. Increased Sparcl1 expression is associated with regions of neuronal injury  , possibly playing a role in the glial activation response.In addition to cell volume regulation  , ion transporters can participate in anchoring the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane by binding to ezrin-radixin-moesin ERM proteins 16 ,17. However  , the mechanistic action of NKCC1 on cell contractility and focal adhesion dynamics in the context of GB cell migration and invasion are entirely unknown.Negative controls for immunohistochemistry were treated without primary antibodies  , and positive labelling for ataxin-3 aggregates was confirmed in pontine neurons. DAB label was generated by GAR/RAM biotin 1:400 and VectaStain ABC 1:400.Neoblasts can be specified to form eyes 48 or protonephridia 49 in regeneration  , and here we demonstrate that some neoblasts near the forming anterior pole express FoxD  , notum  , and prep. We found that a small cluster of cells at the midline expressing notum  , follistatin  , and FoxD emerges from neoblasts in this second phase.Fst has been reported to inhibit ameloblast and osteoblast differentiation 19  , 20  , suggesting a possible association between FAM20C and the TGF-β pathway. In addition to the molecules in the Wnt signaling pathway  , Follistatin Fst  , a potent inhibitor of Activin and the TGF-β pathway  , was significantly upregulated in the bones of 3-week and 6-week-old Fam20c-deficient mice.In contrast  , ExoS ADPRT activity inactivates a wide range of proteins such as several members of the Ras family and related proteins  , cyclophilin A and the Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin ERM proteins. Its GTPase activating protein activity reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton through RhoA  , Rac1 and Cdc42 inactivation.The other Arabidopsis R proteins are highly divergent in their CC domains from ZAR1  , and are found in a large distinct and well-supported clade that includes the highly diverse Arabidopsis RPP13 and RPP8 protein families as well as homologues from several other species Figure 5. Bootstrapped neighbor-joining  , maximum likelihood  , and maximum parsimony analyses provided highly congruent results that identified closely-related ZAR1 homologs in four species  , Ricinus communis castor bean  , Populus trichocarpa poplar  , Vitis vinifera grape  , and Solanum melongen eggplant Figure 5  , Figure S4.FoxD also defines a fourth gene together with wnt1  , notum  , and follistatin that is wound-induced and subsequently expressed in either the anterior or posterior pole. We conclude that FoxD is a wound-induced gene in planarian muscle  , but unique among known planarian wound-induced genes with expression occurring only in ventral midline cells and only following injury that impinges on the midline.SCA3 is caused by an unstable cytosine-adenine-guanine CAG trinucleotide expansion mutation in the ATXN3 gene leading to an expanded polyQ tract within the ataxin-3 ATX-3 protein 4. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 SCA3  , also known as Machado–Joseph disease MJD  , is an autosomal-dominantly inherited ataxia and one of at least nine polyglutamine polyQ neurodegenerative disorders described so far 1–3.Furthermore  , PI4 ,5P2 regulates adhesion turnover by binding to and modulating talin  , vinculin  , ezrin/radixin/moesin  , calpain  , and other proteins involved in adhesion dynamics 8 ,11. Including cofilin  , PI4 ,5P2 also regulates the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton by associating with other proteins such as α-actinin  , WASP/N-WASP  , gelsolin  , profilin  , and villin 8 ,11.Thirteen of the genes tested were expressed in all or part of the notochord in at least one developmental stage: Od-prickle  , Od-quaking  , Od-thrombospondin 3  , Od-Fibrillar collagen 1 Od-FCol1  , Od- β1 ,4-Galactosyltransferase Od-β4-GalT  , Od-Calumenin1  , Od-Calumenin2  , Od-Ezrin/radixin/moesin Od-ERM  , Od-IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein Od-IQGAP  , Od-leprecan  , Od-Zipper Figure. Of the 28 probes tested  , two Od-Noto15b and Od-pellino yielded no signal at any of the stages analyzed  , despite repeated attempts.Given the potential importance of the planarian anterior pole in organizing head regeneration  , we investigated the role of Schmidtea mediterranea FoxD in regeneration. In particular  , DjFoxD is expressed in few cells at the anterior pole region of the planarian D. japonica
34 and FoxD influences expression of follistatin in planarian heads 22  , 34.We employed anti-chd MO at 0.82 ng/µl  , anti-nog MO at 4.22 ng/µl  , and anti-fstl2b MO at 8.45 ng/µl and typically injected 1 nl. The sequences of the chordin  , noggin1  , and follistatin-like2b translation-blocking MOs are reported elsewhere 54.Phosphatidylinositol 4 ,5-bisphosphate PI4 ,5P2 plays central roles in regulating cell migration  , a key step of cancer metastasis  , by modulating adhesion turnover and dynamic cytoskeleton rearrangements 8. Furthermore  , PI4 ,5P2 regulates adhesion turnover by binding to and modulating talin  , vinculin  , ezrin/radixin/moesin  , calpain  , and other proteins involved in adhesion dynamics 8 ,11.In addition to this it has been shown that the presence of additional copies of oriC on a high copy number plasmid  , which would titrate DnaA away from the chromosomal origin  , does not change the timing of initiation 43. Recently it was shown that cells with a reduced cellular amount of DnaA protein caused by an elevated level of SeqA  , which negatively affects the dnaA transcription have no problem initiating replication 42.Subsequently  , specification of anterior pole progenitors occurs within neoblasts. Note that wnt1 is also wound-induced at posterior-facing wounds and that the gene follistatin fst is also wound induced.Because double staining with the Musashi-1 antibody and the anti-polyglutamine or anti–ataxin-3 antibody was not possible  , we identified putative stem cells in the crypts on the basis of their localisation next to the Paneth cells. In agreement with earlier data 21–23  , the Musashi-1 antibody indeed decorated cells adjacent to or in between the Paneth cells Figure 4B and 4C  , further supporting the idea that these are the stem cells within the intestinal epithelium.The structure of these 3 domains has been experimentally determined 11-13. FAK comprises three well-defined domains: an N-terminal four-point-one  , ezrin  , radixin  , moesin FERM domain see 8 ,9  , a central catalytic domain  , and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting FAT domain  , necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of FAK to focal adhesions 10.follistatin  , which encodes a secreted regulator of TGF-β proteins  , is also expressed at the anterior pole and is required for normal head regeneration 22  , but strong inhibition of this gene can also result in the absence of blastema formation indicating a broader role of this gene during regeneration 23. pbx
20 and a LIM-homeobox gene djislet  , 21 are required for regeneration of expression domains of posterior PCGs and the posterior pole marker wnt1.Thus  , with regards to the RT2 model of PNET and possibly other forms of cancer  , it appears that desmosomes primarily serve to maintain cell-cell adhesion and hence suppress the acquisition of an invasive growth capability such that the observed downregulation of desmosomal genes results in the impairment of desmosomal function and a concomitant weakening in cellular adhesion without affecting other parameters of tumorigenesis. Our results are consistent with one of the earliest studies to examine the role of Dsp in vivo  , wherein a skin-specific deletion of catenin alpha 1 Ctnna1; MGI: 88274  , the AJ homologue of Dsp  , led to increased skin proliferation and hyperplasia whereas ablation of Dsp did not 34.Since ExoS inactivates all its protein targets  , overexpression of the yeast homologues of the known human targets should restore yeast growth by titrating ExoS enzymatic activity. In contrast  , ExoS ADPRT activity inactivates a wide range of proteins such as several members of the Ras family and related proteins  , cyclophilin A and the Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin ERM proteins.In E. coli  , immediate reinitiation is prevented  , not by delaying the synthesis of the methylase  , but by preventing its action through sequestration of hemimethylated sister origins by a hemimethylation-specific DNA binding protein  , SeqA 12. In this bacterium also the methylation most likely helps in origin-opening 8  , 10 but plays a more definite role in restricting the initiation to once per cell cycle 11.The most remarkable of these putative outer surface and/or secreted proteins of unknown functions belong to a family of proteins that are huge in size  , ranging from 3 ,000 to 9 ,000 amino acids  , and solely present in the L. kunkeei species complex. Additionally  , homology-based structural analysis also detected regions of similarity to EbhA  , as well as to streptococcal adhesins  , immunoglobulin/albumin-binding domain-like  , and catenin alpha-1 supplementary table S7  , Supplementary Material online  , suggesting a role in attachment.Middle-onset genes begin to be expressed in the notochord by late gastrulation  , when the neural plate becomes distinguishable and is composed of ∼six rows of cells abutting the notochord precursors 32; these genes include Ci-Noto1
22  , Ci-Noto8 Figure 1F–1J  , Ci-Noto4 Figure S1M–S1P  , and Ci-Noto9 Figure S1Q–S1T. Early-onset genes are detected in notochord precursors from gastrulation and include Ci-prickle Ci-pk  , the gene with the earliest onset 22  , Ci-thrombospondin3 Ci-thbs3 Figure 1A–1E  , Ci-fibrillar collagen Ci-FCol1 Figure S1A–S1D  , Ci-Noto5 Figure S1E–S1H  , and Ci-ezrin-radixin-moesin Ci-ERM Figure S1I–S1L.follistatin  , which is required for anterior regeneration 22  , 23  , was also co-expressed with FoxD at the regenerating anterior pole at this regeneration stage Fig. 3A.In addition to the molecules in the Wnt signaling pathway  , Follistatin Fst  , a potent inhibitor of Activin and the TGF-β pathway  , was significantly upregulated in the bones of 3-week and 6-week-old Fam20c-deficient mice. For example  , the level of axis inhibition protein 2 Axin2  , a putative Wnt downstream target gene  , was unchanged in the Fam20c-deficient bone.Ngn2 expression is dependent on Eya1 11 and strong Ngn2 expression is first observed in the geniculate placode at E8.5 and in the petrosal placode at E9.0 18  , while the related factor Ngn1 is only weakly expressed. One such bHLH transcription factor is neurogenin 2 Ngn2.In E. coli  , the newly replicated initiator dnaA promoter and the origin oriC are silenced sequestered by the SeqA protein  , which prevents their reuse for a significant period of the cell cycle. Newly replicated DNA is uniquely marked with hemimethylated sites that lend themselves to regulation in various ways.One such bHLH transcription factor is neurogenin 2 Ngn2. In general  , placodal neuronal differentiation is under the control of the basic-helix-loop-helix bHLH transcription factors  , which are related to the Drosophila atonal and achaete-scute genes 10.How the poles are formed and the role they have in organizing regeneration of an animal with a properly patterned body plan is poorly understood. follistatin  , which encodes a secreted regulator of TGF-β proteins  , is also expressed at the anterior pole and is required for normal head regeneration 22  , but strong inhibition of this gene can also result in the absence of blastema formation indicating a broader role of this gene during regeneration 23.Recently it was shown that cells with a reduced cellular amount of DnaA protein caused by an elevated level of SeqA  , which negatively affects the dnaA transcription have no problem initiating replication 42. It has also been shown that cells grown under different conditions can initiate with widely different amounts of DnaA available per origin 41 and that cells grown in minimal medium supplemented with acetate have more DnaA available per origin than cells grown in richer media 23.Since the DnaA protein has also been shown to regulate several other genes in addition to its own and dnaN see 21 for review  , we also performed RNA sequencing to investigate differences in the transcription between the wild type cells and the cells with two-fold extra DnaA see Materials and Methods. The RNA sequencing also confirmed the unchanged level of the dnaN  , encoding the β clamp of the DNA polymerase  , as well as other genes that might influence the initiation process such as mioC  , gidA  , seqA and nrdAB 21.Immunohistochemistry of ataxin-3 was performed with a polyclonal antibody against the full-length protein a generous gift from H. Paulson  , Iowa City  , United States diluted 1:5000 and with a polyglutamine-expansion specific mouse 1C2 Chemicon; MAB 1574 diluted 1:3000. Human intestine tissue that was obtained from deceased SCA3 patients 24 h after death was fixed in 4% para-formaldehyde and cryosectioned in 50-μm sections.Qualitative analysis of . D No relationship was found between CST6 methylation by MSP and the cystatin M loss in DCIS P = 0.38 and IBC P = 0.50.Another membrane fusion protein elevated in all rhizospheres is encoded by RL4274  , a RND resistance-nodulation-cell division multi-drug exporter Figure 1. An R. etli rmrA mutant produced 40% less nodules on bean roots and had increased sensitivity to phytoalexins  , flavonoids and salicylic acid 18.Sequestration renders DNA unavailable to the methylase. In E. coli  , immediate reinitiation is prevented  , not by delaying the synthesis of the methylase  , but by preventing its action through sequestration of hemimethylated sister origins by a hemimethylation-specific DNA binding protein  , SeqA 12.Genes encoding lysosomal enzymes  , such as cathepsins S  , Z  , and D were each increased several-fold. The expression of cystatin F  , α2-macroglobulin  , and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP were also markedly increased.Ezrin-radixin-moesin ERM proteins bind actin filaments and anchor them to integral plasma membrane proteins. Some examples of ion transporters that show a polarized localization to the leading edge of the cell include NHE1 and AE2 9 ,16 ,17  , which also have K+ channels that are polarized to the rear end of the cell 57.The conserved notochord genes  , quaking  , β4-GalT  , Calumenin1  , Calumenin2 and IQGAP  , which encode  , respectively  , an RNA-binding protein  , an enzyme involved in lactose biosynthesis  , Ca2+-binding proteins  , and a scaffolding protein of the Rho family  , respectively  , have also been found to be expressed in the notochord of other chordates 51 ,52. Ezrin-radixin-moesin  , which belongs to a class of proteins which help to organize the cell cortex through their cytoskeletal and transmembrane interaction domains 50  , has been shown to be required for notochord cell elongation in Ciona intestinalis 49.Dotted white line depicts the animal edge. Yellow arrows point to cells found at the anterior midline expressing both notum and follistatin.Graph shows number of cells expressing both notum and follistatin at the forming anterior pole in different RNAi conditions. Scale bar in left panels  , 100 µm and in right panels  , 50 µm.The sequences of the chordin  , noggin1  , and follistatin-like2b translation-blocking MOs are reported elsewhere 54. Prior to injection  , MOs were diluted to working concentrations in 1× Danieau's Solution 58 mM NaCl  , 0.7 mM KCl  , 0.4 mM MgSO4  , 0.6 mM CaNO32  , 5 mM Hepes pH 7.1–7.3.Signal intensities of target bands were quantified by Image lab software BioRad. Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations; Ataxin-7 10 1:700  , actin 1:500 SC-1616  , Santa Cruz  , CAT 1:500 SC-50508  , Santa Cruz  , SOD1 1:500 SC-11407  , Santa Cruz and GSTA3 1:500 gift from B. Mannervik.FoxDRNAi animals have reduced numbers of follistatin-expressing cells at the anterior pole 22. These observations suggest a role for FoxD in anterior pole regeneration by specifying pole progenitors.LB and RB  , left and right border of the T-DNA; Pnos and pAnos  , promoter and terminator of the nopaline synthase gene; nptII  , coding sequence of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene; SAR  , scaffold attachment region; P and pA  , 35S promoter with duplicated enhancer and terminator of the cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV 35S gene; TL  , 5' UTR of the tobacco etch virus TEV; sp  , native signal peptide; IL-10  , mature IL-10 sequence; His6  , histidine tag; SEKDEL  , ER retention signal; TcR  , C-terminal hinge and transmembrane domain of the human T-cell receptor; cytb5  , transmembrane domain of the rat cytochrome-b5. T-DNA region of the pTRAk plant expression vector and gene cassettes targeting murine and viral IL-10 to different subcellular locations.The set of early-expressed pharyngeal genes Ph-E contained genes whose expression initiated by mid-embryogenesis the “bean” to “comma” stages; Sulston et al. The Nematode Expression Pattern Database Kohara 2001; http://nematode.lab.nig.ac.jp/db/index.html and green fluorescent protein GFP reporters enabled us to identify 37 early-onset and 34 late-onset pharyngeal genes Table S2.A total of 59 transcripts were putatively identified as ABC transporters from the single available castor bean transcriptome from 1KP  , 42 % of the 142 putative genes identified in the genome-sequence derived gene set. These figures represented 42 – 47 % of the number of ABC transporters identified from the reference genome protein sequences.This is a SeqA-Zeo fusion protein since we deleted the seqA gene partially  , and the deleted region was substituted with a ZeocinR cassette in-frame. Note that in the ΔseqA
P strain  , although the SeqA band is missing  , a protein of higher molecular weight interacted with the antibody.In these putative stem cells  , no polyglutamine inclusions were detected Figure 4G and 4H. Because double staining with the Musashi-1 antibody and the anti-polyglutamine or anti–ataxin-3 antibody was not possible  , we identified putative stem cells in the crypts on the basis of their localisation next to the Paneth cells.Our results are consistent with one of the earliest studies to examine the role of Dsp in vivo  , wherein a skin-specific deletion of catenin alpha 1 Ctnna1; MGI: 88274  , the AJ homologue of Dsp  , led to increased skin proliferation and hyperplasia whereas ablation of Dsp did not 34. Although it has been suggested that Dsp and other desmosomal components can affect cellular proliferation and apoptosis 32  , 33  , we did not observe any changes in tumor growth parameters following the genetic deletion of Dsp Figure 2.Note that in the ΔseqA
P strain  , although the SeqA band is missing  , a protein of higher molecular weight interacted with the antibody. The proteins interacting with the antibodies are named on the right.This is believed to be due to irreversible sequestration of hemimethylated plasmid origins by the SeqA protein after the first round of replication 22. In contrast  , plasmids driven by oriC are highly deficient in transformation of dam mutants 11.The RNA sequencing also confirmed the unchanged level of the dnaN  , encoding the β clamp of the DNA polymerase  , as well as other genes that might influence the initiation process such as mioC  , gidA  , seqA and nrdAB 21. We think that it is unlikely that the slight elevation in the level of this protein affects the timing of initiation of replication in the cells with two-fold extra DnaA.An R. etli rmrA mutant produced 40% less nodules on bean roots and had increased sensitivity to phytoalexins  , flavonoids and salicylic acid 18. RmrA is a membrane fusion protein whose role is typically to dock an inner membrane exporter to a TolC-like protein that spans the periplasm and outer membrane.They initiate a cascade of gene activation leading to the expression of terminal neuronal differentiation genes 13 ,14. Neurogenin 1 and neurogenin 2 Ngn2 are transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix bHLH family expressed in the earliest steps of mammalian cortical neurogenesis.GSK-3β/ casein kinase 1 CK1 phosphorylates β-catenin  , targeting it for β-TrCP1-mediated degradation  , which is positively regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha PPARa and PPARb. In the absence of Wnt binding to its receptor  , β-catenin forms a degradation complex that includes the Axin  , adenomatous polyposis coli APC  , and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta GSK-3β proteins.Early-onset genes are detected in notochord precursors from gastrulation and include Ci-prickle Ci-pk  , the gene with the earliest onset 22  , Ci-thrombospondin3 Ci-thbs3 Figure 1A–1E  , Ci-fibrillar collagen Ci-FCol1 Figure S1A–S1D  , Ci-Noto5 Figure S1E–S1H  , and Ci-ezrin-radixin-moesin Ci-ERM Figure S1I–S1L. From these comparisons  , it is evident that the genes controlled by Ci-Bra fall within different classes  , which we define here as early  , middle  , and late onset.NHERF1 and NHERF2 are highly expressed in polarised epithelial cells and are differentially expressed in mammalian tissues 2. Both contain two tandem PDZ PSD-95/Dlg/ZO1 domains PDZ-I and PDZ-II at the amino-terminus and an ezrin-radixin-moesin ERM-interacting domain at the carboxyl-terminus.A Double FISH in control and FoxD RNAi fed animals using follistatin magenta and notum green RNA probes at 48 hours post-amputation. FoxDRNAi animals regenerate a defective anterior pole.At 48 hours following wounding notum and notum cells were reduced from regenerating FoxDRNAi anterior blastemas Fig. FoxDRNAi animals have reduced numbers of follistatin-expressing cells at the anterior pole 22.The wound-induced expression of FoxD occurred within ventral midline cells expressing the midline markers admp and slit Fig. FoxD also defines a fourth gene together with wnt1  , notum  , and follistatin that is wound-induced and subsequently expressed in either the anterior or posterior pole.Bootstrapped neighbor-joining  , maximum likelihood  , and maximum parsimony analyses provided highly congruent results that identified closely-related ZAR1 homologs in four species  , Ricinus communis castor bean  , Populus trichocarpa poplar  , Vitis vinifera grape  , and Solanum melongen eggplant Figure 5  , Figure S4. Since the R proteins RPM1  , PRF and RPS5 interact through their N-terminal coiled-coil CC domain with the T3SE-targeted host protein which they monitor 58–60  , we reanalyzed the phylogenetic relationships among plant R proteins using only the CC domains  , which may provide a basis for identifying R genes that could monitor similar protein families Figure 5.Additionally  , homology-based structural analysis also detected regions of similarity to EbhA  , as well as to streptococcal adhesins  , immunoglobulin/albumin-binding domain-like  , and catenin alpha-1 supplementary table S7  , Supplementary Material online  , suggesting a role in attachment. Psi-BLAST hits were obtained against matrix-binding proteins such as the large EbhA from Staphylococcus aureus.Ezrin-radixin-moesin  , which belongs to a class of proteins which help to organize the cell cortex through their cytoskeletal and transmembrane interaction domains 50  , has been shown to be required for notochord cell elongation in Ciona intestinalis 49. prickle  , which encodes a planar cell polarity protein  , has been shown to be necessary for notochord cell intercalation in both Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi 48 ,49.Binding of Wnt to its receptor and co-receptors causes the activation of Dishevelled Dsh proteins by phosphorylation. GSK-3β/ casein kinase 1 CK1 phosphorylates β-catenin  , targeting it for β-TrCP1-mediated degradation  , which is positively regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha PPARa and PPARb.Both contain two tandem PDZ PSD-95/Dlg/ZO1 domains PDZ-I and PDZ-II at the amino-terminus and an ezrin-radixin-moesin ERM-interacting domain at the carboxyl-terminus. Human NHERF1 is a 358-amino acid protein that shares high homologue at the modular structures with NHERF2 also known as E3KARP or TKA1 3.Both are dependent on Eya1  , but independent of one other. Also  , neurogenin 2 Ngn2 and Phox2a signaling are important for neuronal differentiation within the placodes.In particular  , DjFoxD is expressed in few cells at the anterior pole region of the planarian D. japonica
34 and FoxD influences expression of follistatin in planarian heads 22  , 34. In planarians  , few Fox genes have been described.Note that wnt1 is also wound-induced at posterior-facing wounds and that the gene follistatin fst is also wound induced. C Proposed model for anterior regeneration: Following head amputation  , wound-induced genes  , like notum and wnt1 blue dots are expressed throughout the wound  , whereas FoxD is induced in the ventral midline red dots.The Sparcl1 gene product is a secreted protein that acts as a de-adhesive molecule 37. Sparcl1 is the only gene we have identified that is enriched in the ganglion cell layer and has a polymorphism that results in a non-conservative amino acid change an R to Q at position 384  , near the junction of the acidic N-terminal domain and the Follistatin like domain 38.In C. crecsentus  , the hemimethylated origin and the initiator promoter are also less active but the mechanisms remain unclear. In E. coli  , the newly replicated initiator dnaA promoter and the origin oriC are silenced sequestered by the SeqA protein  , which prevents their reuse for a significant period of the cell cycle.Neurogenin 1 and neurogenin 2 Ngn2 are transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix bHLH family expressed in the earliest steps of mammalian cortical neurogenesis. As shown in figure 3O  , brief expression of mouse Ngn2 for as little as four days sufficed to activate DCX-promoter driven expression of the luciferase reporter gene in NTERA-2 cells  , but not in HeLa cells.We found that a small cluster of cells at the midline expressing notum  , follistatin  , and FoxD emerges from neoblasts in this second phase. This location of FoxD induction highlights the connection between the midline and pole regeneration as an important area for further investigation.Secondly  , sequences of two plant seed storage proteins  , lysine-rich protein LRP from winged bean and methionine-rich 2S albumin from Paradise nut 16 were included in constructs for high protein expression and stable accumulation 18 ,19. Firstly  , the codons of human IGF-I gene were modified to plant-preferred sequence.Indeed  , seqA and dam seqA strains can be transformed by oriC plasmids  , although the efficiency is lower compared to WT due to incompatibility with the chromosomal copy of the origin 15. This is believed to be due to irreversible sequestration of hemimethylated plasmid origins by the SeqA protein after the first round of replication 22.Detection of immunoreactivity by each antibody was performed by the Vectastain Elite ABC reagent Vector Laboratories  , Burlingame  , CA  , USA and 3.3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was used as a chromogen. Sections were incubated with a primary antibody overnight at room temperature after blocking nonspecific proteins with 2% dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline PBS for 30 minutes and 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 h. The antibodies used were ER clone 6F11  , Novocastra  , Vision Systems Inc.  , Norwell  , MA  , USA  , diluted at 1:400  , PR clone 16  , Novocastra  , diluted at 1:800  , C-erb2 clone CB11  , Novocastra  , diluted at 1:400  , C-erb4 clone HFR-1  , Neomarkers  , Fremont  , CA  , USA  , diluted at 1:30  , and cystatin M clone 211515  , R&D Systems  , Minneapolis  , MN  , USA  , diluted at 1:20.Yellow arrows point to cells found at the anterior midline expressing both notum and follistatin. Dotted white boxes are shown at higher magnification on the right panels.Thirdly  , as subcellular targeting is another crucial factor in determining the expression of foreign proteins  , rice glutelin signal peptide SP and ER-retention sequence KDEL were employed for stable accumulation of rhIGF-I in transgenic rice grains. Secondly  , sequences of two plant seed storage proteins  , lysine-rich protein LRP from winged bean and methionine-rich 2S albumin from Paradise nut 16 were included in constructs for high protein expression and stable accumulation 18 ,19.The pathway consists of ligands  , receptors  , and SMAD transducers  , and is tightly controlled by various regulatory layers such as ligand traps e.g.  , noggin  , follistatin  , and gremlin  , inhibitory SMADs i.e.  , SMAD6 and SMAD7  , as well as multiple interactive pathways that cross talk with TGFβ signaling proteins in a context-specific manner 7–9. The transforming growth factor β TGFβ superfamily  , the largest family of secreted growth factors in mammals  , is a conserved family of proteins that play key roles in diverse physiological and pathological processes 1–6.FAK comprises three well-defined domains: an N-terminal four-point-one  , ezrin  , radixin  , moesin FERM domain see 8 ,9  , a central catalytic domain  , and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting FAT domain  , necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of FAK to focal adhesions 10. The kinase and FAT domains are joined by a relatively long  , poorly characterized  , region of ~233 residues containing two proline-rich motifs PR2  , PR3  , which provide the basis for many SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions of FAK 3.During infection of HeLa and fibroblast cells  , P. aeruginosa translocates ExoS and induces cell death by apoptosis 33 ,34. Recently  , ExoS was shown to ADP-ribosylate diverse molecules including cyclophilin A and Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin ERM proteins 31 ,32.ERM proteins associate directly with actin and integral membrane proteins  , which connect the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane 18. In addition to cell volume regulation  , ion transporters can participate in anchoring the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane by binding to ezrin-radixin-moesin ERM proteins 16 ,17.
