For instance  , the phosphomannomutase gene of S. typhimurium is placed at the root of the S. aureus group. This could result from horizontal gene transfer.The essential role of PA in SLD formation was further confirmed when all mutants that develop SLDs were found to accumulate PA Figure 3  , including the seipin-deficient fld1Δ Figure 4 and lipin-deficient pah1Δ Figure 5A and 5B cells. Identification of the cds1 mutant through the screening of the knock-down collection of essential yeast genes turned our attention to PA  , whose critical role in SLD formation was confirmed by the strong “size-reduction” effect of inositol supplementation  , an efficient and reliable way to reduce PA in yeast.Interestingly  , screens of the viable yeast deletion library found extensive clustering of LDs and formation of “Supersized” LDs SLDs that are up to 50 times the normal volume in cells deleted for FLD1
12  , which encodes a functional homologue of a human lipodystrophic protein: seipin 13  , 14. A genome-wide RNA interference RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells identified enzymes of phospholipid biosynthesis as determinants of LD size and number 11.Space savings are also achieved when we prune the inverted list entries corresponding to the leaf nodes  , which account for 50% in ENRON and 55% in PROTEIN of the total number of entries. Recall that index-C does not store the document id for each entry explicitly to achieve space savings  , at the expense of a slightly longer time to report the documents.Oncomodulin A mRNA levels are downregulated in the hair cells of the lateral-line organ arrow in response to Cd exposure. e Control embryo and f 500 μg/l CdCl2-treated embryo hybridized to oncomodulin A antisense mRNA.To gain more insights into the function of Fld1p  , mRNA microarray analysis was performed in WT and fld1Δ cells. SLDs in yeast were originally identified in fld1Δ cells; but the molecular function of Fld1p/seipin remains elusive 22.AGPAT2 catalyzes the formation of phosphatidic acid PA but knocking down AGPAT2 led to elevated levels of several phospholipid species including PA 18  , 19. Genome-wide linkage analysis identified two loci for CGL: CGL type 1 CGL1 is caused by mutations in the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate-O-acyl transferase 2 AGPAT2 gene 16 and CGL2 by mutations in BSCL2 which encodes seipin 17.The specificity of the 2D3-IP protocol to enrich for slipped-DNAs was supported by the inability to detect DNAs derived from a control region lamin B2 that is devoid of unusual structure forming DNA sequence motifs Fig. S3A – indicating that the 2D3 antibody could not detect any slipped-DNAs at either of the non-expanded alleles.e Control embryo and f 500 μg/l CdCl2-treated embryo hybridized to oncomodulin A antisense mRNA. Embryos were treated from 4 to 72 hpf and were then fixed for in situ processing.the mRNA for oncomodulin A also called parvalbumin3a  , which is expressed in the hair cells and supporting cells of neuromasts in untreated embryos  , is barely detectable in the neuromasts of embryos treated with 500 μg/l CdCl2 13/15 embryos  , Figure 5e ,f  , in concordance with the Cd-induced  , 4.4-fold decrease of oncomodulin A mRNA measured by microarray hybridization see Figure 4. The neuromasts of the zebrafish lateral line are very sensitive to a number of compounds including CdCl2 28-30.In HGT-DB  , the phosphomannomutase sequence of S. Typhimurium is tagged as horizontal transfer 56  , but not the other two original sequences detected by the hierarchical classification. To see if the original sequences are horizontal transfers  , we examined two horizontal transfer databases: HGT-DB 56 and HGT Analysis Database 57.The misplacement of this gene may indicate a horizontal transfer in S. typhimurium from an unknown donor. Despite that  , the other phosphomannomutase signatures are correctly assigned to their host species.Thus our novel result suggests original sequences that need to be studied more precisely before being incorporated into a multigene study. In HGT-DB  , the phosphomannomutase sequence of S. Typhimurium is tagged as horizontal transfer 56  , but not the other two original sequences detected by the hierarchical classification.In the phosphomannomutase NJ tree and the signature tree  , the relationships between the Gram- and the Gram+ bacteria are incongruent with other data and presumably wrong. For instance  , the phosphomannomutase gene of S. typhimurium is placed at the root of the S. aureus group.In contrast  , although Fld1p yeast seipin has been implicated in lipid metabolism  , little information is available on its molecular function 12  , 22. Therefore  , both AGPAT2 and lipin-1 appear to control adipogenesis through modulation of the synthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerol precursors  , especially PA.g Control and h Cd-treated embryos hybridized to a thioredoxin antisense probe. Oncomodulin A mRNA levels are downregulated in the hair cells of the lateral-line organ arrow in response to Cd exposure.SLDs in yeast were originally identified in fld1Δ cells; but the molecular function of Fld1p/seipin remains elusive 22. A recent study in Drosophila also revealed a possible role for dSeipin in PA metabolism 34.Thus  , even though fewer genes respond to these lower concentrations  , the measured changes in transcript levels are robust. Cytochrome P4501a1 was fivefold upregulated by 50 ng/l TCDD  , oncomodulin A was reduced 4.5-fold by 0.5 mg/l Cd and peroxiredoxin was still 3.5-fold induced by 6 μg/l MeHg.Despite that  , the other phosphomannomutase signatures are correctly assigned to their host species. In the phosphomannomutase NJ tree and the signature tree  , the relationships between the Gram- and the Gram+ bacteria are incongruent with other data and presumably wrong.Cytochrome P4501a1 was fivefold upregulated by 50 ng/l TCDD  , oncomodulin A was reduced 4.5-fold by 0.5 mg/l Cd and peroxiredoxin was still 3.5-fold induced by 6 μg/l MeHg. It is clear  , however  , that the number of genes with a significant response to the toxicants decreases see Table 6.LDs of various sizes have been observed in different tissues or within the same cell type under different pathophysiological conditions 7  , 8. Interestingly  , screens of the viable yeast deletion library found extensive clustering of LDs and formation of “Supersized” LDs SLDs that are up to 50 times the normal volume in cells deleted for FLD1
12  , which encodes a functional homologue of a human lipodystrophic protein: seipin 13  , 14.
