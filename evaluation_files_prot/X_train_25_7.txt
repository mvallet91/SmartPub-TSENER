Calpain-mediated cleavage of α-fodrin protein into 145 KDa BDPs could be seen on day 0 of culture dissociated cells prior to culture prior to the initiation of DNA fragmentation 2 days. To further detect whether cellular mechanisms mediating this apoptotic process involve activation of these proteases  , cleavage of α-fodrin was measured by using Western blot analysis with cells from fresh tissue  , day 0  , day 1  , day 3  , days 7 and 8 in culture Figure 8B.As one component of the class III phosphatidylinositol kinase PI3K  , beclin-1 initiates autophagy through the interaction with the other components of the PI3K pathway. Beclin-1 is essential for the initial steps of autophagy.While the effects of Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency are relatively mild in AR113Q muscle  , lifespan extension is striking  , and likely reflects benefits of limited autophagy in cell types other than muscle fibers  , perhaps including effects on metabolism. In contrast  , limiting autophagy prolongs lifespan and maintains motor function in SBMA mice.All of the genes described earlier were annotated throughout this work. This gene encodes two enzymes  , the aforementioned UDP–glucose–4–epimerase and the aldose–1–epimerase  , that converts α–D–glucose into β–D–glucose.Thus  , calpain activity began to increase at 6 hours after 7–8 mM glutamate exposure  , which preceded glutamate-induced LDH release and apoptotic cell death  , and was robustly activated by 7–8 hours. As shown in Figure 7A  , glutamate induced calpain activity in a time-dependent manner.Furthermore  , almost all beclin-1-upregulating cells displayed punctate LC3 fluorescence. We consistently found that autophagy  , as evidenced by punctate LC3 staining  , was significantly increased following focal cerebral ischemia.Similarly  , a set of variants shared across 3 strains and 1 variant shared in 2 strains are found in loci that form well-supported clades in the locus phylogeny. A phylogeny of the entire cluster 4 locus across all 62 strains with short-read data shows that 2 pseudogenizing variants shared across multiple strains  , one in the aldose 1-epimerase gene and one in the PKS  , are found in loci that form well-supported clades Fig 3B  , suggesting that these variants arose once.Lifespan extension was not associated with rescue to wild type levels of body mass or motor performance as measured by grip strength Figure 6B  , 6C. AR113Q males exhibited a mean survival of 21.6 wks; Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency extended mean lifespan by ∼44% to 31.1 wks.Okamura and colleagues showed that ADAM17/TACE can bind to and cleave neogenin  , regulating the behavior of rat cortical neurons in response to RGM 51. Earlier work using ADAM inhibitors and rat dorsal spinal cord explants showed that DCC undergoes ADAM-dependent proteolytic processing  , which may affect its role in regulating axon migration 50.Defining the targets affected by Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency that mediate lifespan extension remains an important goal for future work. While the effects of Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency are relatively mild in AR113Q muscle  , lifespan extension is striking  , and likely reflects benefits of limited autophagy in cell types other than muscle fibers  , perhaps including effects on metabolism.Notably  , strategies to modulate the activity of the autophagic pathway have attracted considerable attention as studies in several polyglutamine disease models have documented degradation of cytoplasmic protein aggregates through autophagy 55. Defining the targets affected by Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency that mediate lifespan extension remains an important goal for future work.To measure in vivo calcineurin activity directly  , we used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET-based calcineurin activity sensor that utilizes a calcineurin activity-dependent molecular switch based on the N-terminal regulatory domain of nuclear factor of activated T cells NFAT as a specific substrate  , which was inserted between CFP and YFP 31. We found that calcineurin protein levels were significantly decreased p = .0414 in synaptosomes following TTX treatment Figure 2a.Autophagy has been well documented in different models of cerebral ischemia. These results suggested that the colocalization of beclin-1 and Mcl1 may favor cell survival following focal cerebral ischemia.Given that beclin-1 is localized primarily within cytoplasmic structures  , including the endoplasmic reticulum  , mitochondria and the perinuclear membrane  , and that Mcl1 is a mitochondrial protein 5  , it is highly possible that Mcl1 may interact with beclin-1 via the BH3 domain on mitochondria to prevent ischemic cell death 8. Indeed  , several Bcl-2 family proteins  , such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL  , have been reported to inhibit beclin-1-dependent autophagy through the interaction with the BH3 domain of beclin-1.Consistent with the notion that the effects of Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency on motor function were most manifest in older mice  , we found no change in the age of disease onset defined as the point at which grip strength was 5% less than controls due to Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency Figure 6D. However  , AR113Q males haploinsufficient for Beclin-1 aged over 20 weeks maintained motor function while AR113Q  , Beclin-1 wild type littermates exhibited a marked drop-off Figure 6C.Similar to effects following surgical denervation  , Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency significantly increased AR113Q muscle fiber size  , although in this case the effect was less robust Figure 5A. To accomplish this  , we generated AR113Q males haploinsufficient for Beclin-1.Quantification demonstrated that the numbers of beclin-1 immunoreactive cells and the levels of beclin-1 protein changed from 4 to 72 hours in the ipsilateral ischemic cortex and striatum n = 4/group  , *P < 0.001 compared with control group  , #P < 0.001 compared with the previous time point; Figure 3B; C  , a. Western blotting indicated that beclin-1 protein levels were elevated in the ipsilateral ischemic cerebral cortex and the striatum at all time points when compared with sham-operated control animals Figure 3C  , a.Pre-administration of 3-MA consistently inhibited the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in the ischemic hemisphere following MCAO. 3-MA is a relatively selective inhibitor of the class III PI3K and has been shown to inhibit beclin-1-dependent autophagy in different disease models 19.In other examples  , a pair of positively correlated alternative exons with distinct neural specific splicing levels is detected in transcripts from the Exoc7/Exo70 gene Figure 2b  , and a pair of negatively correlated alternative exons  , with each exon also displaying distinct levels in CNS tissues  , is detected in transcripts from the Neogenin Neo1 gene Figure 2c. Consistent with this observation and the analyses described above  , about 50% of genes with significantly correlated pairs of AS events are known to have neural specific functions Additional data file 4.A similar expression pattern of LC3 and beclin-1 Figure 3C  , indicated that beclin-1 was a major component in ischemia-induced autophagy. In the present study  , almost all cells with strong punctate LC3 staining were labeled with beclin-1 Figure 3A  , e.We also visualized the C. elegans mitofusin EAT-3 by introducing a similar EAT-3::GFP chimeric transgene into nematodes; EAT-3::GFP was localized to puncta  , similar to GFP::DRP-1 Figure S1D. We introduced this transgene into nematodes and observed that GFP::DRP-1 was localized to punctate structures in neuron cell bodies data not shown and along the ventral cord neurites Figure S1A.Glutamate toxicity appears to involve a rapid Ca2+ influx into neurons and these high levels of intracellular Ca2+ are cytotoxic 12 ,13. Recent studies demonstrate that calpain  , a calcium-dependent protease  , and apoptosis inducing factor AIF can play an important role in apoptotic cell death via a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway 7-11.3-MA is a relatively selective inhibitor of the class III PI3K and has been shown to inhibit beclin-1-dependent autophagy in different disease models 19. As one component of the class III phosphatidylinositol kinase PI3K  , beclin-1 initiates autophagy through the interaction with the other components of the PI3K pathway.We note that we also observed an enrichment of both the autophagy protein beclin 1 and lysosome-associated membrane protein type 1 Lamp1 levels in the 800×g low-speed P1 fractions from Hdh and Hdh striatal extracts prepared by lysis in the absence of detergent Figure S3A. A corresponding western blot analysis of LC3 levels in total unfractionated  protein extracts from 2 year old mice revealed an increase in LC3-II in both the Hdh and Hdh samples Figure S3B.D Pretreatment with 3-MA before MCAO significantly blocked autophagy but did not affect the protein levels of Mcl1. C Some beclin-1expressing cells displayed the characteristic features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage and pyknotic nuclei small arrow  , whereas those cells coexpressing Mcl1 and beclin-1 displayed little chromatin clumping  , and their nuclei were not pyknotic  , as demonstrated by co-labeling with DAPI big arrows.Although we observed NFAT1 nuclear translocation in response to PMA/ionomycin  , we were unable to detect phosphorylation of NFAT1S79. Whether this is a direct effect on NFAT-1-calcineurin binding or is indirect via  , for example  , enhanced phosphorylation of other residues or dissociation of an inactive cytoplasmic protein complex containing NFAT1 remains to be determined.By contrast  , in the absence of Bcl-2 binding  , beclin-1 mutants induce excessive autophagy and promote cell death 21. The interaction of Bcl-2 homologs with the BH3 domain can prevent the release of beclin-1  , thereby inhibiting beclin-1-dependent autophagy.This gene encodes two enzymes  , the aforementioned UDP–glucose–4–epimerase and the aldose–1–epimerase  , that converts α–D–glucose into β–D–glucose. The UDP–galactose formed by this reaction will be again converted to UDP–glucose by the GAL10 bifunctional gene.T cells express NFAT1  , NFAT2  , and NFAT4  , which are activated by TCR-mediated stimulation to induce proliferation and cytokine secretion 2. There are 5 NFAT family members: NFAT1 also known as NFATc2 or NFATp  , NFAT2 NFATc1 or NFATc  , NFAT3 NFATc4  , NFAT4 NFATc3 or NFATx  , and NFAT5 tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein TonEBP 2.Further  , 19 strains shared a single frameshift variant in the PKS gene 4380_4381insAATGGGCT; frameshift at Glu1461 in Afu1g17740 and an additional 13 strains shared a single frameshift variant 242delG; frameshift at Gly81 in an aldose 1-epimerase gene Afu1g17723 Fig 3A  , S2 Table. The 4 strains lacking the cluster form a single clade on the strain phylogeny  , suggesting that the cluster was lost in a single deletion event Fig 1.Recently  , van Erp and colleagues showed that ADAM17/TACE-mediated cleavage of neogenin is regulated by the leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains Lrig protein Lrig2  , and that this regulation is required for RGM-mediated neurite growth inhibition in vitro and cortical neuron migration in vivo 52. Okamura and colleagues showed that ADAM17/TACE can bind to and cleave neogenin  , regulating the behavior of rat cortical neurons in response to RGM 51.Transfections of the breast cancer cell line Hs578T with cDNA for COX-2 led to an increase in expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2  , resulting in increasingly invasive behavior of the cells 17. Another transgenic overexpression study with COX-2 targeted to the epidermis also supports the concept that COX-2 is a critical regulator of tumor progression 16.To directly test the notion that CHOP deficiency enhanced muscle wasting by activating autophagy  , we generated CHOP null mice haploinsufficient for Beclin-1 Figure 4E. Muscle haploinsufficient for Beclin-1 exhibited significantly increased mean fiber size compared to either wild type or CHOP null muscle following surgical denervation Figure 4D supporting a role for autophagy in muscle wasting.C The N1KO Jurkat clone was infected with retrovirus encoding HA-NFAT or HA-NFAT1S79A  , followed by single cell sorting of green fluorescent protein-positive GFP+ cells. B WT or N1KO Jurkat clones were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28  , PMA/ionomycin  , or medium alone for 48 hours  , and NFAT2 expression was determined by immunoblotting.A phylogeny of the entire cluster 4 locus across all 62 strains with short-read data shows that 2 pseudogenizing variants shared across multiple strains  , one in the aldose 1-epimerase gene and one in the PKS  , are found in loci that form well-supported clades Fig 3B  , suggesting that these variants arose once. Finally  , functional alleles of cluster 4 are distributed throughout the locus phylogeny  , suggesting that the functional allele is ancestral and the pseudogenized variants are derived.Results indicated Mcl1 and beclin-1 may operate together in the same cells after ischemic reperfusion. Approximately 44.9%  , 56.1%  , and 50.9% of cells were double labeled in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere at 4  , 24 and 72 hours  , respectively n = 4/group  , *P < 0.001 compared with control group  , #P < 0.001 compared with the previous time point; Figure 4B.Beclin-1 contains a BH3 domain that is sufficient and essential for binding to Bcl-2 homologs 20. One possible explanation is that Mcl1 may interact with beclin-1 to protect against cell death beyond the PI3K complex.We suggest that this reflects predominant degradation of the AR by the proteasome  , a protein quality control pathway active in the nucleus. As the polyglutamine AR resides in the nucleus in the presence of ligand and largely escapes degradation through this pathway 43  , we found that soluble and aggregated species of the mutant AR do not change when mice are deficient in CHOP or haploinsufficient for Beclin-1.Interestingly  , some beclin-1 expressing cells displayed the characteristic features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage and pyknotic nuclei Figure 4C  , small arrow  , whereas those cells coexpressing Mcl1 and beclin-1 displayed little chromatin clumping  , and their nuclei were not pyknotic as demonstrated by co-labeling with DAPI Figure 4C  , big arrows. Results indicated Mcl1 and beclin-1 may operate together in the same cells after ischemic reperfusion.When examined in more detail  , we discover that the four query sequences that identified candidate F in their BLAST output are multifunctional proteins with both aldose-1-epimerase activity and UDP-glucose 4-epimerase activity. In the last example  , both proteins have excellent BLAST E-values; in fact  , the E-value for protein F indicates a better match with the query sequences than the E-value for protein E. In this case  , protein E is found in 19 lists of BLAST hits versus four for protein F  , and on average aligns with a much larger fraction of each query sequence.To confirm that the enhanced LC3 immunostaining observed in the Hdh and Hdh striatum was due to an increase in LC3-II levels  , dissected striata from 2 year old wild-type  , Hdh  , Hdh  , and Hdh mice n = 4 of each genotype were homogenized and separated into supernatant NP40-soluble and pellet NP40-insoluble fractions  , and then analyzed by western blotting with an antibody that recognizes both LC3-I and LC3-II Figure 5B and 5C. Lamp1 is a marker for late endososomes  , amphisomomes formed after autophgagosome-late-endosome fusion  , dense autolysosomes and lysosomes that are enriched in the 800×g P1 fraction 37  , and these observations  , together with our findings related to the alterations in beclin 1 and LC3-II fractionation  , suggest that the subcellular distribution of several components of the autophagy pathway are altered by ΔQ-htt expression.Limiting activity of the autophagic pathway did not alter levels of either the wild type or polyglutamine AR protein Figure 5B  , consistent with the notion that other protein quality control pathways  , such as the proteasome  , degrade the receptor once localized to the nucleus. Similar to effects following surgical denervation  , Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency significantly increased AR113Q muscle fiber size  , although in this case the effect was less robust Figure 5A.These results suggested that the colocalization of beclin-1 and Mcl1 may favor cell survival following focal cerebral ischemia. More importantly  , all beclin-1/Mcl1 positive cells were not TUNEL negative.Muscle haploinsufficient for Beclin-1 exhibited significantly increased mean fiber size compared to either wild type or CHOP null muscle following surgical denervation Figure 4D supporting a role for autophagy in muscle wasting. Mice haploinsufficient for Beclin-1 form fewer autophagosomes in skeletal muscle 49 and therefore allowed us to probe the role of autophagy in the response of muscle to sciatic nerve transection.This difference may reflect variations in the extent to which autophagy is disrupted  , as Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency decreases autophagosome number but does not completely block this pathway. The extension of AR113Q lifespan by Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency contrasts with findings in Drosophila showing that disruption of autophagy exacerbates degeneration when the polyglutamine AR is expressed in the eye 54.If the reduction in mitochondrial size during anoxia is a result of changes in fission/fusion dynamics  , then mutations in drp-1 should block the effects of anoxia on mitochondrial length  , and mutations in eat-3 should preclude any additional reduction in size caused by anoxia. By contrast  , under normoxia mitochondria from mutants for the mitofusin eat-3 were smaller than wild type and similar in size to those found in anoxia-exposed animals Figure 2G ,J  , although more numerous Figure 2K  , consistent with a block in fusion.LC3 has been used as a specific marker to monitor autophagy. Quantification demonstrated that the numbers of beclin-1 immunoreactive cells and the levels of beclin-1 protein changed from 4 to 72 hours in the ipsilateral ischemic cortex and striatum n = 4/group  , *P < 0.001 compared with control group  , #P < 0.001 compared with the previous time point; Figure 3B; C  , a.The possible breast cancer relevance of known or suspected interactions of PGRMC1 with PAIRBP1/CGI-55  , neogenin and DCC deleted in colon cancer are considered in the supplementary discussion included in Additional file 1. It is reasonable to speculate that differences in the phosphorylation status of PGRMC1 can affect the proteins with which it interacts  , and thereby affect cellular biology.Following denervation  , these mice exhibited significantly less atrophy than CHOP null males  , demonstrating that the effects of CHOP deficiency on muscle wasting were mediated through autophagy. To directly test the notion that CHOP deficiency enhanced muscle wasting by activating autophagy  , we generated CHOP null mice haploinsufficient for Beclin-1 Figure 4E.Beclin-1 encoded by Becn1 is a critical regulator of autophagy that binds class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase and is both required for the initiation of autophagosome formation and contributes to autophagosome maturation 48. To confirm that autophagy contributes to muscle atrophy following surgical denervation  , we transected the sciatic nerve of Beclin-1 haploinsufficient male mice 47.Mice haploinsufficient for Beclin-1 form fewer autophagosomes in skeletal muscle 49 and therefore allowed us to probe the role of autophagy in the response of muscle to sciatic nerve transection. Beclin-1 encoded by Becn1 is a critical regulator of autophagy that binds class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase and is both required for the initiation of autophagosome formation and contributes to autophagosome maturation 48.To further explore the relationship between Mcl1 and autophagy  , rats were pretreated with 3-MA before MCAO. The present data suggested that Mcl1 expression may lie upstream of autophagosome formation and potentially modulate beclin-1-induced autophagy.Thus  , it seems unlikely that enzymatic conversion of oligosaccharides to their β-anomers is necessary for efficient CDH catalysis. However  , we did not detect elevated transcripts or peptides corresponding to the two P. gigantea aldose 1-epimerase genes even though these were previously observed in culture filtrates of various white-rot fungi 21  , 62  , including Bjerkandera adusta  , Ganoderma sp  , and Phlebia brevispora
17.Beclin-1 is essential for the initial steps of autophagy. Given that beclin-1 is localized primarily within cytoplasmic structures  , including the endoplasmic reticulum  , mitochondria and the perinuclear membrane  , and that Mcl1 is a mitochondrial protein 5  , it is highly possible that Mcl1 may interact with beclin-1 via the BH3 domain on mitochondria to prevent ischemic cell death 8.The lifespan of AR113Q males haploinsufficient for Beclin-1 was extended on average by ∼10 wks compared to AR113Q  , Beclin-1 wild type littermates Figure 6A. Despite the limited changes in AR113Q muscle  , Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency had a striking effect on survival.In summary  , the present study demonstrates the expression and cellular localization of Mcl1 in the brains of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury model rats. Mcl1 may inhibit cell death  , at least partially through colocalization with beclin-1.Tachykinin  , ghrelin  , and calcium-sensing receptor activity were measured using a cell-based Ca flux assay by Multispan  , Inc. Hayward  , California. Radioligand binding assays for the oxytocin receptor  , D4 dopamine receptor  , cannabinoid CB2 receptor  , and angiotensin type I and II receptors were performed as described previously  , as were cell-based activity assays for mGluR 1a  , 2  , 4  , 5  , 6  , and 8 60–62.The present data suggested that Mcl1 potentially inhibited beclin-1-induced cell death. Interestingly  , some beclin-1 expressing cells displayed the characteristic features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage and pyknotic nuclei Figure 4C  , small arrow  , whereas those cells coexpressing Mcl1 and beclin-1 displayed little chromatin clumping  , and their nuclei were not pyknotic as demonstrated by co-labeling with DAPI Figure 4C  , big arrows.The present data suggested that Mcl1 expression may lie upstream of autophagosome formation and potentially modulate beclin-1-induced autophagy. &P > 0.10  , #P < 0.001 compared with NS group; *P < 0.001 compared with control group.Extensive loss of mtDNA also occurs in mouse Mitofusin mutants the mammalian homologues of Fzo1 66. Second  , C. elegans fzo-1tm1133 mutant animals are not as severely affected as eat-3 mutants  , nor are they rescued by drp-1 RNAi data not shown  , even though one might expect them to be equally susceptible to loss of mtDNA  , since yeast Fzo1 mutants do lose their mtDNA 12 ,48 and they are rescued by mutations in Dnm1 19 ,21 ,22.When engaged by B7  , CTLA4 plays a key role as a negative regulator of T cell activation through down-regulation of cytokine production by preventing the accumulation of activator protein AP-1  , NF-κB  , and NFAT nuclear factor of activated T-cells in the nucleus. The mechanism of T cell inactivation involves antagonism of CD28-dependent costimulation and direct negative signaling through its cytoplasmic tail.Our data highlight the central role of the UPR in remodeling the activity of the protein quality control machinery  , and indicate that robust activation of autophagy accentuates the muscle atrophy of SBMA. While CHOP deficiency activates autophagy and enhances muscle wasting in SBMA mice  , limiting autophagy by Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency diminishes muscle atrophy  , maintains motor function in aged animals and markedly extends lifespan.Indeed  , several Bcl-2 family proteins  , such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL  , have been reported to inhibit beclin-1-dependent autophagy through the interaction with the BH3 domain of beclin-1. By contrast  , in the absence of Bcl-2 binding  , beclin-1 mutants induce excessive autophagy and promote cell death 21.The extension of AR113Q lifespan by Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency contrasts with findings in Drosophila showing that disruption of autophagy exacerbates degeneration when the polyglutamine AR is expressed in the eye 54. We suggest that this reflects predominant degradation of the AR by the proteasome  , a protein quality control pathway active in the nucleus.Last  , methyltransferase enzymes themselves can show some DNA-sequence preferences 80  , 81  , and members of the methyl-binding proteins family e.g.  , MeCP2 and MBD2  , while lacking sequence-specificity  , participate in protein complexes that bind highly methylated CpG-rich sequences and can help to maintain repressive chromatin 82. 79 showed that most major classes of TFs  , including bHLH  , bZIP  , and ETS  , bind preferentially to unmethylated DNA  , whereas other TFs  , such as homeodomain  , POU  , and NFAT  , bind preferentially to methylated DNA.Left panel shows fiber size distribution  , and right panel shows relative fiber cross sectional area mean +/− SEM. Muscle fiber size 100 fibers/mouse was quantified from proximal hind limb muscle of AR113Q red  , n = 6 or AR113Q  , Beclin-1 +/− blue  , n = 6 mice at 16 wks.While CHOP deficiency activates autophagy and enhances muscle wasting in SBMA mice  , limiting autophagy by Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency diminishes muscle atrophy  , maintains motor function in aged animals and markedly extends lifespan. Notably  , in both cases  , enhanced muscle wasting due to CHOP deficiency is mediated by increased autophagy  , a lysosomal protein quality control pathway that has emerged as a central regulator of proteostasis in several protein aggregation neurodegenerative diseases.Exoc7/Exo70 is a component of exocyst complex that is involved in vesicle-mediated exocytosis and functions in membrane targeting of neurotransmitter receptors for γ-aminobutyric acid GABA and N-methyl-D-aspartate 35-37  , and Neo1 is a widely expressed cell surface receptor that is involved in axon guidance and in the regulation of neuronal survival 38 ,39. In other examples  , a pair of positively correlated alternative exons with distinct neural specific splicing levels is detected in transcripts from the Exoc7/Exo70 gene Figure 2b  , and a pair of negatively correlated alternative exons  , with each exon also displaying distinct levels in CNS tissues  , is detected in transcripts from the Neogenin Neo1 gene Figure 2c.Lamp1 is a marker for late endososomes  , amphisomomes formed after autophgagosome-late-endosome fusion  , dense autolysosomes and lysosomes that are enriched in the 800×g P1 fraction 37  , and these observations  , together with our findings related to the alterations in beclin 1 and LC3-II fractionation  , suggest that the subcellular distribution of several components of the autophagy pathway are altered by ΔQ-htt expression. Overall levels of beclin 1 and Lamp1 in total brain extract  , however  , were similar in all genotypes Figure S3B.Our findings highlight cross-talk between the UPR and autophagy  , and demonstrate that increased autophagy promotes atrophy of SBMA muscle. In contrast  , diminished autophagy due to Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency decreased muscle wasting and extended the lifespan of AR113Q males  , unexpectedly ameliorating the disease phenotype.B Striata dissected from wild-type  , Hdh  , Hdh  , and Hdh mice n = 2 of each genotype were homogenized and aliquots of the unfractionated extract were analyzed by western blotting using antibodies specific for LC3  , beclin 1  , and lamp1. Both lamp1 and beclin 1 are enriched in the P1 fractions from the Hdh and Hdh striata  , but are difficult to detect in the wild type and Hdh fractions.Blots were then stripped and re-probed with a β-actin antibody loading control. B Striata dissected from wild-type  , Hdh  , Hdh  , and Hdh mice n = 2 of each genotype were homogenized and aliquots of the unfractionated extract were analyzed by western blotting using antibodies specific for LC3  , beclin 1  , and lamp1.We exposed animals carrying these transgenes to anoxia and reoxygenation; however  , we did not observe any significant changes in GFP::DRP-1 or EAT-3::GFP subcellular localization Figure S1B ,C ,E ,F. We also visualized the C. elegans mitofusin EAT-3 by introducing a similar EAT-3::GFP chimeric transgene into nematodes; EAT-3::GFP was localized to puncta  , similar to GFP::DRP-1 Figure S1D.The activation further increased up to 7 days. Calpain-mediated cleavage of α-fodrin protein into 145 KDa BDPs could be seen on day 0 of culture dissociated cells prior to culture prior to the initiation of DNA fragmentation 2 days.Protein F aligns with the amino-terminal region of each of the four query sequences  , and has no detected similarity in the carboxy-terminal regions. When examined in more detail  , we discover that the four query sequences that identified candidate F in their BLAST output are multifunctional proteins with both aldose-1-epimerase activity and UDP-glucose 4-epimerase activity.Optical densities of respective protein bands were analyzed with Image J 1.42q and normalized to the loading control β-actin. C Western blot analysis of protein levels of beclin-1  , LC3 and β-actin in the rat cortex and striatum derived from the control and MCAO group.This concept of senescence as a useful cancer-protective mechanism in younger life but a detrimental cancer-promoting mechanism in later life has repeatedly been described as an example of ‘antagonistic pleiotropy’ 27  , 28 in cellular or animal models 23  , 24  , 29–32. In this process  , a major role has been attributed to matrix metalloproteinase 3 23 together with other components of the SASP 25  , 26  , such as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.One simple mechanism by which anoxia might regulate mitochondrial dynamics would be through the enhanced recruitment  , turnover  , or stabilization of the mitochondrial dynamics machinery during reoxygenation 50  , 51  , 52. These results suggest that anoxia and EGL-9 might regulate mitochondrial dynamics by a mechanism other than DRP-1 or mitofusin recruitment.Recent studies demonstrate that calpain  , a calcium-dependent protease  , and apoptosis inducing factor AIF can play an important role in apoptotic cell death via a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway 7-11. Calpain is also implicated in neuronal cell death associated with cerebral ischemia and other neuronal insults 28 ,29.AR113Q males exhibited a mean survival of 21.6 wks; Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency extended mean lifespan by ∼44% to 31.1 wks. The lifespan of AR113Q males haploinsufficient for Beclin-1 was extended on average by ∼10 wks compared to AR113Q  , Beclin-1 wild type littermates Figure 6A.Upregulation of beclin-1 partly contributed to cell death. Scale bars = 50 μm.Many Mcl1 positive cells also expressed beclin-1 at different time points Figure 4A  , a-d. Mcl1 is a stress sensor that regulates autophagy and the balance between autophagy and apoptosis 7 ,8.As the polyglutamine AR resides in the nucleus in the presence of ligand and largely escapes degradation through this pathway 43  , we found that soluble and aggregated species of the mutant AR do not change when mice are deficient in CHOP or haploinsufficient for Beclin-1. The functional consequences of altered autophagy in SBMA mice were unexpected and suggest that limiting activity of this pathway is beneficial for certain aspects of the disease phenotype.This observation indicated that cerebral ischemia may induce autophagy in a beclin-1 dependent-manner. Furthermore  , almost all beclin-1-upregulating cells displayed punctate LC3 fluorescence.Mcl1 is a stress sensor that regulates autophagy and the balance between autophagy and apoptosis 7 ,8. The present data suggested that Mcl1 potentially inhibited beclin-1-induced cell death.Additionally  , small molecule activators of autophagy reportedly promote survival of cultured motor neurons expressing the polyglutamine AR 43  , raising the possibility that the findings described here in AR113Q mice reflect predominant effects outside the CNS  , such as in skeletal muscle. This difference may reflect variations in the extent to which autophagy is disrupted  , as Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency decreases autophagosome number but does not completely block this pathway.CTLA4 was found to be upregulated in our human TReg cells. When engaged by B7  , CTLA4 plays a key role as a negative regulator of T cell activation through down-regulation of cytokine production by preventing the accumulation of activator protein AP-1  , NF-κB  , and NFAT nuclear factor of activated T-cells in the nucleus.In mammary epithelial or tumor cells  , the exposure of nicotine initiated a signaling cascade that involved PKC protein kinase C and cdc42  , and consequently accelerated cell migration 7. It was reported that nicotine potently induced secretion of different types of calpain from lung cancer cells  , which then promoted cleavage of various substrates in the extracellular matrix to facilitate metastasis and tumor progression 5.Quantitation of transduced gene product expression in 2 independent clones from each transduction was determined by immunoblotting with anti-HA. C The N1KO Jurkat clone was infected with retrovirus encoding HA-NFAT or HA-NFAT1S79A  , followed by single cell sorting of green fluorescent protein-positive GFP+ cells.Despite the limited changes in AR113Q muscle  , Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency had a striking effect on survival. Our data indicate that Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency significantly extended the duration of disease by prolonging survival and maintaining motor function of SBMA mice.We next quantified Lamp1-positive and p62-negative vesicles in Purkinje cell somata of brain sections from 2-month-old and 11-month-old mice  , respectively Fig 7F–7H. Levels of p62 were strongly elevated in the Triton X-100 insoluble fractions of KO whole brain lysates as well as in lysates of selected brain regions S6 Fig  , whereas levels of Beclin-1  , one of the key proteins for the initial steps of autophagosome formation 20  , were not changed Fig 7E and 7E’.To confirm that autophagy contributes to muscle atrophy following surgical denervation  , we transected the sciatic nerve of Beclin-1 haploinsufficient male mice 47. Following denervation  , these mice exhibited significantly less atrophy than CHOP null males  , demonstrating that the effects of CHOP deficiency on muscle wasting were mediated through autophagy.In contrast  , diminished autophagy due to Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency decreased muscle wasting and extended the lifespan of AR113Q males  , unexpectedly ameliorating the disease phenotype. Further  , we show that enhanced muscle wasting in the setting of CHOP deficiency is due to increased macroautophagy hereafter referred to as autophagy  , a lysosomal protein quality control pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine and motor neuron diseases.Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse 1:6000; EarthOx  , USA or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies 1:6000; EarthOx. Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-Mcl1 1:2000; Abcam  , rabbit anti-beclin-1 1:1000; Abcam  , rabbit anti-LC3B 1:2000; Novus Biologicals  , and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin 1:3000; Proteintech Group Inc.COX-2 specific inhibitors have the ability to block cell growth  , and induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in murine mammary tumor cell lines 18. Transfections of the breast cancer cell line Hs578T with cDNA for COX-2 led to an increase in expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2  , resulting in increasingly invasive behavior of the cells 17.Although the data above does not prove  , it certainly suggests that the increased cellular infiltration in the lungs of the arthritic mice versus the non-arthritic mice may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the increased rate of metastasis observed in the arthritic mice Figure 3j. Preliminary analysis of the BAL from SKG + zymozan  , and SKG mice showed higher levels of pro-matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9  , macrophage colony stimulating factor M-CSF and IL-17 compared with the BAL from Balb/c + zymozan mice data not shown.Whether this is a direct effect on NFAT-1-calcineurin binding or is indirect via  , for example  , enhanced phosphorylation of other residues or dissociation of an inactive cytoplasmic protein complex containing NFAT1 remains to be determined. Both coimmunoprecipitation assays and PLAs demonstrated that phosphorylation of this site  , which is near the NFAT1 calcineurin-binding sequence PxIxIT residues 111–116  , promotes NFAT1-calcineurin interactions.However  , AR113Q males haploinsufficient for Beclin-1 aged over 20 weeks maintained motor function while AR113Q  , Beclin-1 wild type littermates exhibited a marked drop-off Figure 6C. Lifespan extension was not associated with rescue to wild type levels of body mass or motor performance as measured by grip strength Figure 6B  , 6C.Blots were then stripped and re-probed with a tubulin antibody loading control. Aliquots of the P1 fraction were analyzed by western blotting using antibodies specific for lamp1 marker for lysosomes and autolysosomes and beclin 1 an essential autophagy protein involved in autophagosome nucleation.However  , we did not detect elevated transcripts or peptides corresponding to the two P. gigantea aldose 1-epimerase genes even though these were previously observed in culture filtrates of various white-rot fungi 21  , 62  , including Bjerkandera adusta  , Ganoderma sp  , and Phlebia brevispora
17. The observed coordinate expression of CDH and LPMO may reflect oxidative ‘boosting’ as recently demonstrated 19  , 20  , 47  , 61.Our data indicate that Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency significantly extended the duration of disease by prolonging survival and maintaining motor function of SBMA mice. Consistent with the notion that the effects of Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency on motor function were most manifest in older mice  , we found no change in the age of disease onset defined as the point at which grip strength was 5% less than controls due to Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency Figure 6D.These results strongly indicate that glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death in HT22 cells is executed through a caspase-independent pathway as has been observed in platelets 7. In addition  , glutamate-induced DNA fragmentation ladder can be reduced or blocked by calpain inhibitors but not by caspase inhibitors in this cell line.By contrast  , under normoxia mitochondria from mutants for the mitofusin eat-3 were smaller than wild type and similar in size to those found in anoxia-exposed animals Figure 2G ,J  , although more numerous Figure 2K  , consistent with a block in fusion. Mutants for drp-1 contained a smaller number of individual mitochondria  , and these mitochondria were far more elongated than ever observed in wild type Figure 2D ,J ,K  , consistent with impaired fission.Mcl1 may inhibit cell death  , at least partially through colocalization with beclin-1. In addition  , our findings suggest that expression of Mcl1 is associated with the survival of neurons following ischemic stroke.Beclin-1 immunoreactivity was weak in brains from sham-operated control rats Figure 3A  , a  , left panel. A similar expression pattern of LC3 and beclin-1 Figure 3C  , indicated that beclin-1 was a major component in ischemia-induced autophagy.Aliquots of the P1 fraction were analyzed by western blotting using antibodies specific for lamp1 marker for lysosomes and autolysosomes and beclin 1 an essential autophagy protein involved in autophagosome nucleation. A Striata dissected from wild-type +/+  , Hdh  , Hdh  , and Hdh mice n = 2 of each genotype were homogenized and then centrifuged at 800×g  , to generate a low-speed P1 fraction see Methods.Western blotting indicated that beclin-1 protein levels were elevated in the ipsilateral ischemic cerebral cortex and the striatum at all time points when compared with sham-operated control animals Figure 3C  , a. Beclin-1 positive cells started to increase at 4 hours  , reaching a peak at 24 hours and declining at 72 hours  , but still remained highly expressed after 1 hour of focal cerebral ischemia Figure 3A  , b-d  , left panel.However  , 3-MA did not affect protein expression of Mcl1  , suggesting that PI3K might not be involved in the regulation of the interaction between Mcl1 and beclin-1. Pre-administration of 3-MA consistently inhibited the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in the ischemic hemisphere following MCAO.Beclin-1 positive cells increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere in a time-dependent manner after cerebral ischemia. Beclin-1 immunoreactivity was weak in brains from sham-operated control rats Figure 3A  , a  , left panel.One possible explanation is that Mcl1 may interact with beclin-1 to protect against cell death beyond the PI3K complex. However  , 3-MA did not affect protein expression of Mcl1  , suggesting that PI3K might not be involved in the regulation of the interaction between Mcl1 and beclin-1.In the present study  , almost all cells with strong punctate LC3 staining were labeled with beclin-1 Figure 3A  , e. LC3 has been used as a specific marker to monitor autophagy.Examples of small GTPase homologs are arf-1.2  , eef-2 and tba-2  , whose C. elegans orthologs are essential for embryonic  , larval  , and/or reproductive development. Based on homology with C. elegans proteins  , we predicted 247 GTPases  , including 215 small GTPases representing the Rho n = 50  , Rab n = 38  , Ran n = 57  , Arf n = 23  , and Miro n = 2 families  , and a small number of large GTPases such as dyamin  , GBP  , and mitofusin; n = 15; see Additional file 1  , Table S7.After a 14–16 hour treatment  , degradation of native α-fodrin was observed and BDPs were less noticeable. Thus  , calpain activity began to increase at 6 hours after 7–8 mM glutamate exposure  , which preceded glutamate-induced LDH release and apoptotic cell death  , and was robustly activated by 7–8 hours.Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-Mcl1 1:2000; Abcam  , rabbit anti-beclin-1 1:1000; Abcam  , rabbit anti-LC3B 1:2000; Novus Biologicals  , and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin 1:3000; Proteintech Group Inc. The membranes were then incubated with primary and secondary antibodies.Left panel shows fiber size distribution  , middle panel shows cumulative percent of fibers as a function of fiber area  , and right panel shows relative fiber cross sectional area mean +/− SEM. E. Muscle fiber size 100 fibers/mouse was quantified from CHOP −/− black  , n = 6 or CHOP −/−  , Beclin-1 +/− mice white  , n = 6 7 days post sciatic nerve transection.Earlier work using ADAM inhibitors and rat dorsal spinal cord explants showed that DCC undergoes ADAM-dependent proteolytic processing  , which may affect its role in regulating axon migration 50. There are other reports showing that neogenin or DCC can be cleaved by ADAM proteases.Beclin-1 positive cells started to increase at 4 hours  , reaching a peak at 24 hours and declining at 72 hours  , but still remained highly expressed after 1 hour of focal cerebral ischemia Figure 3A  , b-d  , left panel. Beclin-1 positive cells increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere in a time-dependent manner after cerebral ischemia.Preliminary analysis of the BAL from SKG + zymozan  , and SKG mice showed higher levels of pro-matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9  , macrophage colony stimulating factor M-CSF and IL-17 compared with the BAL from Balb/c + zymozan mice data not shown. Data clearly shows that BAL collected from the SKG + zymozan or SKG lungs significantly augment the invasiveness of the 4T1 cells as compared with the BAL from Balb/c or Balb/c + zymosan lungs Figure 4u.Eleven other strains each contained 1 to several frameshift or nonsense polymorphisms involving 9 unique mutational sites. Further  , 19 strains shared a single frameshift variant in the PKS gene 4380_4381insAATGGGCT; frameshift at Glu1461 in Afu1g17740 and an additional 13 strains shared a single frameshift variant 242delG; frameshift at Gly81 in an aldose 1-epimerase gene Afu1g17723 Fig 3A  , S2 Table.The interaction of Bcl-2 homologs with the BH3 domain can prevent the release of beclin-1  , thereby inhibiting beclin-1-dependent autophagy. Beclin-1 contains a BH3 domain that is sufficient and essential for binding to Bcl-2 homologs 20.C Some beclin-1expressing cells displayed the characteristic features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage and pyknotic nuclei small arrow  , whereas those cells coexpressing Mcl1 and beclin-1 displayed little chromatin clumping  , and their nuclei were not pyknotic  , as demonstrated by co-labeling with DAPI big arrows. *P < 0.001 vs. control group  , #P < 0.001 vs. the previous time point.More importantly  , all beclin-1/Mcl1 positive cells were not TUNEL negative. The beclin-1/Mcl1 positive cells had normal morphology and their nuclei were not pyknotic.The beclin-1/Mcl1 positive cells had normal morphology and their nuclei were not pyknotic. Interestingly  , some beclin-1 positive cells were also Mcl1 positive  , suggesting ischemia-induced coexpression of beclin-1 and Mcl1 in some neural cells.Mcl1 potentially modulated beclin-1-induced autophagy. Scale bars = 50 μm in A  , 20 μm in C.Semi-quantitative assessment showed that approximately 35.3% beclin-1 positive cells expressed both beclin-1 and Mcl1 in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the control group. Many Mcl1 positive cells also expressed beclin-1 at different time points Figure 4A  , a-d.To accomplish this  , we generated AR113Q males haploinsufficient for Beclin-1. Our finding that enhanced autophagy triggered by CHOP deficiency promoted muscle wasting in AR113Q mice prompted us to determine the consequences of limiting autophagy on the SBMA phenotype.Future research should address what role  , if any  , these proposed interactions of PGRMC1 with those candidate interaction partners may play in breast cancer. The possible breast cancer relevance of known or suspected interactions of PGRMC1 with PAIRBP1/CGI-55  , neogenin and DCC deleted in colon cancer are considered in the supplementary discussion included in Additional file 1.These results suggest that anoxia and EGL-9 might regulate mitochondrial dynamics by a mechanism other than DRP-1 or mitofusin recruitment. We also examined the localization of these proteins in egl-9 mutants under the same conditions  , but did not observe significant changes data not shown.
