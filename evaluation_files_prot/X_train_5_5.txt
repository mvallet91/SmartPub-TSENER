Overexpression of paxillin  , however  , did not reduce escape times of dag1 or itga7 morphants. Exogenous NAD+ or Emergen-C not shown significantly reduced the escape times of both dag1 and itga7 morphants.Growing evidence indicates active crosstalk between different adhesion sites and this can be at least partially mediated by localization of certain proteins like vinculin and paxillin to both focal adhesions and AJs 26  , 55. The molecular mechanism by which lack of paxillin phosphorylation leads to increased plasmamembranous localization of itself and vinculin remains a subject of future studies  , but non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src and focal adhesion kinase FAK as well the small GTPase Rac1 are shown to mediate shuttling between FAs and AJs in other cell types  , and therefore are good candidates 55  , 56.Based on our results we suggest that MAPK activity regulates cyclin D1-mediated progression of cell cycle from G1 to S  , and normal cellular adhesion through phosphorylation of paxillin in FAs. Our findings demonstrate the importance of Mek1/Mek2 in activation of MAPK pathway during UB branching  , which is largely blocked in dko kidneys.Same as A  , except that HEK293T cells were co-transfected with an increasing amount of complexin-1 Cpx1 expression plasmid n = 4 independent experiments. B. Complexin increases SNARE complex assembly.We find that Dag1 and Nrk2b are required for paxillin localization to the MTJ. Our data show that laminin polymerization is necessary and sufficient for muscle fiber homeostasis and that NAD+ and paxillin increase laminin polymerization.Protein concentration was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer  , and sample concentrations were normalized prior to loading. Immunodetection of paxillin was conducted using preparations from 2 dpf embryos as previously described 27.G Average escape response times of 2 dpf dystrophic zebrafish after exogenous NAD+ treatment or overexpression of paxillin. F dag1 MOs;Tg:paxillin:GFP embryo.Unlike the distantly related src kinases  , PTK6 lacks a myristylation sequence. There are increasing numbers of PTK6 kinase substrates  , including Sam68  , Stat3/5b  , BKS  , Fak  , Cbl  , and paxillin  , many of which are known to play critical roles in oncogenic signaling 12–19.Cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides  , mKO-paxillin  , and GFP-speckle-actin by using Amaxa nucleofection  , as described earlier. Protrusion rates were determined by using ImageJ Kymograph software National Institutes of Health and calculated as the length of the protrusion divided by the total time of the movie.Either disruption of ERK/paxillin complex or lack of ERK induced phosphorylation on serine 83 abolishes cell spreading and branching morphogenesis 24  , 25. ERKs have a wide variety of nuclear and cytosolic targets including cyclin D1 and focal adhesion FA scaffold protein paxillin  , which also associates with MEK 23  , 24.Rabbit anti-pErk1/2 Cell Signaling  , 1∶2000  , anti-ERK2 K-23  , Sant Cruz  , 1∶1000  , pS83 paxillin ECM Biosciences  , 1∶1000 and mouse paxillin ECM Biosciences  , 1∶1000 were used with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies to detect proteins which were visualized by Pierce ECL Western Blotting detection system Thermo Scientific and Fuji film LAS1000. Western blotting was done as previously described 60.Secondary antibodies were GAM/GAR 488  , 546  , and 633 Invitrogen  , 1∶200 dilution in block. Primary antibodies were polyclonal anti-laminin-111 Thermo Scientific  , 1∶50 dilution in block and monoclonal anti-paxillin BD Biosciences  , 1∶50 dilution in block.For paxillin phosphorylation  , UB cells were serum-starved for 4 h and followed by fetal bovine serum FBS treatment of indicated times and 15 µM UO126 was used for inhibiting MAPK activity 30 min prior plus during the induction with FBS. 1×105 cells for MEK-inhibition experiments 2 h were plated 24 h before performing the inhibition by UO126 after which they were collected in lysis buffer.There are at least three possible explanations for why Itga6 and Itga7  , but not Dag1  , are required for paxillin overexpression-mediated restoration of muscle structure. It is very interesting that paxillin overexpression does not rescue morphogenesis/reduce dystrophy in itga6 or itga7 morphants.Intriguingly  , another component of the exocyst is Arf6  , which would require NAD+ as a cofactor for ADP-ribosylation of its targets. Thus  , one mechanism by which paxillin could function upstream of Itga6 and Itga7 is modulation of exocyst localization.Paxillin localization to Itga6 and Itga7 containing cell-ECM adhesions may directly or indirectly cause these laminin receptors to adopt their high-affinity conformation  , thus increasing adhesion to laminin. Another scenario that would explain these results is that paxillin modulates “inside-out” signaling via Itga6 and Itga7.Additionally to amplified FA localization  , vinculin is also intensively distributed to cell surfaces arrowheads. Both paxillin J  , M and vinculin K  , N are intensified in FAs of dko cells M–N while are more diffusely distributed in control cells J–K.Yeast and human Nrks function in an alternative salvage pathway that generates Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide NAD+ 28 ,29. We found that Nicotinamide riboside kinase 2b Nrk2b Q7ZUR6_DANRE-mediated NAD+ synthesis potentiates laminin polymerization and subcellular localization of paxillin Q6R3L1_DANRE  , an integrin-associated adaptor protein 27.These results clearly implicate paxillin in playing a fundamental role in muscle homeostasis. Here we show that overexpression of paxillin in dag1 morphants increases organization of laminin-111 at the MTJ and reduces dystrophy.There are increasing numbers of PTK6 kinase substrates  , including Sam68  , Stat3/5b  , BKS  , Fak  , Cbl  , and paxillin  , many of which are known to play critical roles in oncogenic signaling 12–19. PTK6 promotes oncogenic phenotypes including enhanced proliferation  , enhanced anoikis resistance  , regulation of autophagy  , epithelial-mesenchymal transition  , and migration/invasion  , via kinase activity-dependent and possibly independent mechanisms 2  , 6–11.Total DNA was kept constant by balancing the complexin-1 plasmid with pCMV5 emerald 4 to 0-fold. For complexin titration experiments  , HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV5 syntaxin-1a  , pCMV5 SNAP-25a  , pCMV5 synaptobrevin-2 1:1:1  , and an increasing amount of pCMV5 complexin-1 0 to 4-fold.In addition  , blue light promotes CO expression by stabilizing the FLAVIN-binding KELCH DOMAIN F BOX PROTEIN1 FKF1-GI protein complex 9  , 10. Phytochrome A phyA  , phytochrome B phyB and cryptochrome 2 cry2 regulate FT expression by post-translationally regulating CO protein 7  , 8.As paxillin is an integrin adaptor protein  , it is perhaps not surprising that paxillin-mediated BM augmentation requires functional integrin receptors for laminin. Paxillin also localized to the MTJ in itga7 morphants Figure 7G  , and paxillin overexpression in itga7 morphants had no effect on the percent of myotomes per embryo with dystrophic lesions Figure 7H–J; p = 0.9.The mTORC2 complex is involved in cytoskeletal organisation via paxillin  , rho/rac and PKBα  , but it also plays a key role in cell proliferation and survival via activation of serum and glucocorticoid protein kinase 1 SGK1 and direct activation of Akt
8. In the less well-defined rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2 complex
11  , mTOR is associated with the rapamycin insensitive companion RICTOR  , LST8  , mSIN1  , PROCTOR and DEPTOR and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on t37/46 is also considered rapamycin insensitive
12.D Bar chart of the quantification of focal adhesion area stained with vinculin left panel and paxillin right panel antibodies. B–C NS 318 control shRNA left panel  , NKCC1 shRNA middle panel  , and wild-type treated with 5 µM paclitaxel right panel stained with an anti-vinculin antibody B and anti-paxillin antibody C to visualize focal adhesions lower panels in B and C show an amplification of areas within the squares.The intracellular cell-ECM adhesion protein paxillin is downstream of Nrk2b-mediated NAD+ synthesis during MTJ development 27. We find that the mechanism of action of zebrafish Nrk2b involves a different integrin receptor for laminin  , integrin alpha6 Itga6 A8WHQ8_DANRE.Based on our phylogeny  , we hypothesize that in ancestral Bilateria three Cryptochromes Cry1/2/3  , Cry4/5  , and Cry6 built the basis for all currently known family members. The investigation of cry sequences from a variety of over 100 Bilateria led us to draw a comprehensive picture of Cryptochrome evolutionary history and to gain new insight into possible evolutionary events in the different invertebrate and vertebrate lineages.However  , the characterisation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 as rapamycin-sensitive and insensitive complexes may not always be entirely accurate  , as chronic rapamycin treatment has also been reported to inhibit mTORC2 activity by blocking its assembly
8 ,13. The mTORC2 complex is involved in cytoskeletal organisation via paxillin  , rho/rac and PKBα  , but it also plays a key role in cell proliferation and survival via activation of serum and glucocorticoid protein kinase 1 SGK1 and direct activation of Akt
8.H Paxillin overexpression significantly reduces the frequency of fiber detachment in dag1 morphants; *p<0.05. G Transgenic overexpression of paxillin green in dag1 morphants reduces fiber detachment.In addition to FAK protein levels  , we also evaluated the phosphorylation status of the FAK binding partners p130Cas  , Paxillin and c-Src in these cells. Immunoblot analyses with FAK-specific antisera of cell lysates from FAKflx/flx cell lines revealed that FAK expression was lost upon infection with retroviral Cre vector  , demonstrating efficient deletion of FAK Figure 4a.N.S.  , not significant. Together  , these results suggest that Itga6 and Itga7 are required for paxillin-mediated improvements in muscle tissue.For Syt1 titration experiments in presence of complexin-1  , HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV5 syntaxin-1a  , pCMV5 SNAP-25a  , pCMV5 synaptobrevin-2  , pCMV5 complexin-1 1:1:1:3  , and an increasing amount of pCMV5 Syt1 0 to 4-fold. For Syt1 titration experiments  , HEK293T cells were cotransfected as above  , except that pCMV5 complexin-1 was replaced with pCMV5 Syt1.Phospho-p130Cas 4011  , AKT 9272  , phospho-AKT 9271  , ERK1/2 9102  , phospho-ERK1/2 9106  , phospho-c-Src 2101  , and phospho-Paxillin 2541 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Neu sc-284 and CK8 sc-101459 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz  , CA  , USA and Paxillin 610051  , FAK 610087 and p130Cas 610271 were from BD Biosciences Mississauga  , ON  , Canada.E In contrast  , paxillin overexpression green in dag1 morphants reduces laminin-111 within myotomes and enhances organization of laminin-111 at the MTJ BM white arrows. D dag1 morphant laminin-111 appears within myotomes  , and the MTJ BM is poorly aligned medially laterally and contains holes white arrowheads.I Model of cell adhesion at the MTJ in response to Nrk2b pathway activation via exogenous NAD+ or paxillin overexpression. H Paxillin overexpression significantly reduces the frequency of fiber detachment in dag1 morphants; *p<0.05.Thus  , one mechanism by which paxillin could function upstream of Itga6 and Itga7 is modulation of exocyst localization. Paxillin binding to an exocyst component  , Sec5  , mediates proper subcellular localization of exocyst complexes 61.Paxillin overexpression increased organization of laminin-111 at the MTJ in 2 dpf dag1 morphants compare Figure 6E to 6D; 2DWTMM analysis not shown; *p<0.05 for wavelets from 1.88 to 4.02 micrometers. Paxillin:GFP accounted for approximately 66.05%±8% of total paxillin expressed at 2 dpf in Tg:paxillin:GFP embryos unpublished data.Similarly  , the EDI EARLY DAY-LENGTH INSENSITIVE allele of the photoreceptor CRY2 CRYPTOCHROME 2 causes early flowering under short days  , but appears to be restricted to accessions from the Cape Verde Islands 14. A naturally occurring deletion in FLM  , which causes early flowering in both long and short days 12  , has so far only been found in accessions from Niederzenz 13.Through interactions with a diverse range of proteins including adapters such as particularly interesting Cys-His-rich protein PINCH  , calponin homology-containing ILK-binding protein CH-ILKBP  , affixin and paxillin  , kinases such as integrin-linked kinase-associated serine/threonine phosphatase 2C ILKAP  , protein kinase B AKT and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 PDK-1  , and transmembrane receptors such as β1 and β3 integrins 1  , ILK is thought to play a key role in integrin and growth factor receptor related signaling cascades 2 ,3. Integrin-linked kinase ILK  , an intracellular serine/threonine kinase  , is a key signaling molecule expressed in most  , if not all  , tissues  , with high levels of expression in normal pancreatic  , cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues.Our results clearly show that MTJ-localized paxillin is sufficient to impact local organization of the ECM microenvironment. Intriguingly  , another component of the exocyst is Arf6  , which would require NAD+ as a cofactor for ADP-ribosylation of its targets.B. Complexin increases SNARE complex assembly. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for Syt1  , emerald  , SNARE complexes high molecular mass bands  , and total SNARE proteins  , followed by quantitation n = 4 independent experiments.Paxillin is a direct phosphorylation target of ERK-proteins and lack of pERK-induced phosphorylation on serine 83 of paxillin leads to functional defects in cell spreading and branching morphogenesis 24  , 25. Growing evidence indicates active crosstalk between different adhesion sites and this can be at least partially mediated by localization of certain proteins like vinculin and paxillin to both focal adhesions and AJs 26  , 55.A Paxillin concentrates at the MTJ in both untreated not shown and NAD+-treated controls white arrows. A–C Anterior left  , dorsal top  , side-mounted  , 1 dpf embryos antibody stained for paxillin white.Together  , these results suggest that Itga6 and Itga7 are required for paxillin-mediated improvements in muscle tissue. J Paxillin overexpression does not affect fiber detachment frequency in itga7 morphants.We asked whether overexpression of paxillin would be sufficient to augment MTJ BM organization in dystrophic embryos. Thus  , likely through “inside-out” signaling via laminin receptors  , paxillin is sufficient to affect the ECM microenvironment.A Baseline MAPK activity as measured by phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is dose-dependently inhibited by UO126 in 2 h. B Paxillin phosphorylation on serine 83 is slightly increased by addition of FBS but greatly reduced by inhibition of MEK1/2 function. Scale bar: 20 µm.We next asked whether improvements in MTJ BM structure and maintenance of fiber attachment in dystrophic zebrafish correlated with physiological improvements by assaying the average time it takes for dystrophic embryos to swim a predetermined distance following a touch stimulus. These results indicate that improving basement membrane structure in dystrophic zebrafish by overexpressing paxillin is not sufficient to improve mobility.Cell lysates were immunoblotted for Syt-1  , Cpx1  , emerald  , SNARE complexes high molecular mass bands  , and total SNARE proteins followed by quantitation n = 6 independent experiments. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid expressing Synt-1  , SNAP-25  , Syb-2  , and complexin-1 in a 1:1:1:3 ratio  , together with an increasing amount of Syt1 expression plasmid 0 to 4-fold  , and decreasing amount of emerald expression plasmid GFP; 4 to 0-fold.BT-549 cells were transfected with siRNA siLuc or siSTAT5b  , GFP-speckle-actin  , and mKO-paxillin. STAT5b-knockdown cells exhibit multiple protrusions with increased retraction.Scale bars are 50 micrometers. I Model of cell adhesion at the MTJ in response to Nrk2b pathway activation via exogenous NAD+ or paxillin overexpression.Primary antibodies were polyclonal anti-laminin-111 Thermo Scientific  , 1∶50 dilution in block and monoclonal anti-paxillin BD Biosciences  , 1∶50 dilution in block. Embryos were washed in PBS-0.1%Tw prior to imaging.These kinase-dependent functions are likely due to phosphorylation and/or activation of an increasing number of PTK6 substrate molecules  , including Sam68  , Stat3/5b  , paxillin  , BKS/STAP2  , p130CAS  , AKT  , β-catenin  , and p190RhoGAP 12–17  , 19  , 20  , 62–64. Kinase activity of overexpressed PTK6 is also responsible for enhanced cell migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells 19.In some breast cancer cells  , PKD forms a complex with cortactin and paxillin  , which are both associated with invadopodia membranes 4. Breast cancer cells invade surrounding tissues by breaking through the basal membrane using invadopodia  , which participate in proteolytic matrix degradation.The ablation of FAK function was further accompanied by reduced total Paxillin protein and reduced but not lost tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK substrates such as p130Cas and Paxillin Figure S4 in Additional file 4. We confirmed that this basal level of FAK protein levels was due to the adjacent stroma by subjecting tumour sections to immunohistochemical analyses with both Cre- and FAK-specific antisera Figure 6b.A & B. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid-expressing syntaxin-1a Synt-1  , SNAP-25  , synaptobrevin-2 Syb-2  , and complexin-1 Cpx1 in a constant 1:1:1:3 ratio  , together with an increasing amount of Syt1 expression plasmid 0 to 4-fold and a decreasing amount of emerald expression plasmid GFP; 4 to 0-fold to balance the total DNA amount. The data used to make this figure can be found in S1 Data.Seventy-two hours after transfection  , cells were plated on FN 2 μg/ml  , and after 20 to 30 minutes of spreading  , TIRF images were acquired by using an inverted microscope  , 60× objective Olympus  , model IX70. Cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides  , mKO-paxillin  , and GFP-speckle-actin by using Amaxa nucleofection  , as described earlier.Paxillin overexpression also significantly reduced the incidence of fiber detachment in 3 dpf Dag1-deficient embryos Figure 6F–H; *p<0.05. Paxillin overexpression increased organization of laminin-111 at the MTJ in 2 dpf dag1 morphants compare Figure 6E to 6D; 2DWTMM analysis not shown; *p<0.05 for wavelets from 1.88 to 4.02 micrometers.However c-Src  , ERK and AKT activation were not affected by FAK deletion Figure S4 in Additional file 4. The ablation of FAK function was further accompanied by reduced total Paxillin protein and reduced but not lost tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK substrates such as p130Cas and Paxillin Figure S4 in Additional file 4.Herein we will investigate whether the Nrk2b pathway can be exploited to augment laminin polymerization and thus improve muscle tissue structure and function in dystrophic embryos. Our previous results showing a requirement for Nrk2b-generated NAD+ in initial BM morphogenesis lead us to hypothesize that activation of the Nrk2b pathway  , either through chemical NAD+ supplementation or gene therapy paxillin overexpression approaches  , would be sufficient to activate the intrinsic compensation between cell-ECM adhesion proteins and result in a novel method of BM augmentation.Finally  , paxillin could be required to recruit the exocyst to the MTJ. Paxillin localization to Itga6 and Itga7 containing cell-ECM adhesions may directly or indirectly cause these laminin receptors to adopt their high-affinity conformation  , thus increasing adhesion to laminin.The MAPK pathway appears to contribute to UB branching guidance by carrying out dual functions; it regulates G1/S-phase transition during cell cycle progression  , and epithelial cell adhesion through paxillin phosphorylation affecting FA and AJ dynamics. As previously suggested by chemical inhibition of MAPK in whole kidney cultures 10  , 11  , our results show definitively that loss of MAPK activity specifically in the UB prevents the generation of new branches while allowing bud elongation.C Quantification of MTJ failure shows that paxillin overexpression does not rescue itga6 morphants. A–B Antibody staining shows that paxillin green concentrates at the MTJ in itga6 morphants B as in controls A.Concomitant with abolition of FAK protein  , we noted a significant reduction in the levels of phosphorylated c-Src  , Paxillin and p130Cas Figure 4a. In addition to FAK protein levels  , we also evaluated the phosphorylation status of the FAK binding partners p130Cas  , Paxillin and c-Src in these cells.D–E Anterior left  , dorsal top  , side-mounted  , 2 dpf embryos stained with laminin-111 antibody white. C NAD+ rescues the disrupted concentration of paxillin at the MTJ in dag1 morphants white arrows.Figure showing that focal adhesion kinase FAK-ablated tumours show reduced levels of tyrosine phosphorylated p130Cas and Paxillin. P < 0.05 vs. FAKwt/wt mice  , Student's t-test.We observed small  , thin  , and elongated focal adhesions primarily in the extending processes in control virus shRNA cells  , whereas in NKCC1 shRNA cells  , focal adhesions were much larger Figure 4B–C and Figure S4  , indicative of focal adhesion maturation 22 ,48. Focal adhesions were stained with an antibody against vinculin and paxillin  , cytoskeletal proteins that are part of focal adhesions that also regulate mechanical coupling of the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix ECM.Cryptochrome 6 was likely lost at the basis of the Chordate evolution  , which explains the appearance of Cry6 in Echinodermata and various Protostomia but its absence in Tunicates and Cephalochordates. Eumetazoan Cryptochrome genes originated from three ancestral genes in the last common Bilateria ancestor  , namely Cry1/2/3  , Cry4/5  , and Cry6.wi390/laminin gamma1−/− embryos 72 were obtained from natural spawnings of identified heterozygotes. Embryos stably overexpressing paxillin fused to GFP were obtained from pairwise spawnings of carriers from the F1 generation of the Tg:paxillin:GFP line described in 27.Taken together  , these data provide fundamental new insights into the adaptability of cell adhesion mechanisms in vivo and the phenotypic consequences of this adaptability. Finally  , we show that NAD+ plays a dual role in ameliorating dystrophy: NAD+-mediated paxillin clustering improves muscle structure and adhesion  , but NAD+ acts independently of paxillin to improve motility.ERKs have a wide variety of nuclear and cytosolic targets including cyclin D1 and focal adhesion FA scaffold protein paxillin  , which also associates with MEK 23  , 24. The activation of RAF kinases leads to rather linear signal transduction upon phosphorylation of dual-specificity protein kinases MEK1 and −2  , which in turn phosphorylate ERK1 and −2 presently their only known substrates 22.Circadian clocks in mammalian tissues generate molecular circadian rhythms through coupled transcription/translation feedback loops in which the positive gene elements Clock and Bmal1 interact with the negative gene elements Period Per 1 and 2  , and Cryptochrome Cry 1 and 2  , and in which casein kinases  , CKIɛ and CKIδ  , set circadian period by phosphorylating PER proteins to regulate their degradation and nuclear localization 38 ,40. However  , it is unclear from these in vivo studies whether circadian rhythms of retinal gene expression are self-sustained or driven by the master SCN clock.NAD+ supplementation improved paxillin concentration at the MTJ in 26 hpf dag1 morphants Figure 6C. Paxillin concentration at the MTJ was slightly disrupted in dag1 morphants at 26 hpf Figure 6B.Eumetazoan Cryptochrome genes originated from three ancestral genes in the last common Bilateria ancestor  , namely Cry1/2/3  , Cry4/5  , and Cry6. Overall  , the number of cryptochrome genes among species varies considerably.In itga6 morphants  , paxillin concentrated at the MTJ as in control embryos Figure 7A–B. We analyzed both the subcellular localization of paxillin upon Itga6 or Itga7 knockdown as well as the ability of transgenic paxillin overexpression to rescue the muscle defects observed in itga6 or itga7 morphants.G Transgenic overexpression of paxillin green in dag1 morphants reduces fiber detachment. F dag1 morphant with detached fibers white arrowhead.Next  , we overexpressed paxillin in dag1 morphants by injecting dag1 MOs into Tg:paxillin:GFP embryos. NAD+ supplementation improved paxillin concentration at the MTJ in 26 hpf dag1 morphants Figure 6C.Total DNA was kept constant by balancing the Syt1 plasmid with pCMV5 emerald 4 to 0-fold. For Syt1 titration experiments in presence of complexin-1  , HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV5 syntaxin-1a  , pCMV5 SNAP-25a  , pCMV5 synaptobrevin-2  , pCMV5 complexin-1 1:1:1:3  , and an increasing amount of pCMV5 Syt1 0 to 4-fold.These results indicate that improving basement membrane structure in dystrophic zebrafish by overexpressing paxillin is not sufficient to improve mobility. Interestingly  , however  , Tg:paxillin:GFP embryos injected with dag1 MOs or itga7 MOs actually tended to be slower than dag1 or itga7 morphants  , respectively Figure 8F ,G.Paxillin is an essential signaling nexus that regulates cell adhesion  , morphology  , and migration 59. Paxillin overexpression is also sufficient to restore laminin organization in dystrophic zebrafish.Our previous results showing a requirement for Nrk2b-generated NAD+ in initial BM morphogenesis lead us to hypothesize that activation of the Nrk2b pathway  , either through chemical NAD+ supplementation or gene therapy paxillin overexpression approaches  , would be sufficient to activate the intrinsic compensation between cell-ECM adhesion proteins and result in a novel method of BM augmentation. Exogenous NAD+ rescues MTJ morphogenesis in Nrk2b-deficient zebrafish embryos  , indicating that zebrafish Nrk2b also functions to generate NAD+.a FAK ablation in NDL2-5 cell lines decreases phosphorylation of p130Cas  , Paxillin and c-Src. Focal adhesion kinase FAK deletion in established ErbB2 tumour cells results in impaired tumour growth.Taken together  , these results suggest manipulation of NAD+ precursors/biosynthetic enzymes and paxillin as new potential therapeutic approaches for treatment of not only muscle diseases but also diseases/syndromes that affect laminin integrity. Paxillin overexpression was sufficient to improve laminin organization and significantly reduce muscle defects in dag1 morphants.For complexin titration experiments  , HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV5 syntaxin-1a  , pCMV5 SNAP-25a  , pCMV5 synaptobrevin-2 1:1:1  , and an increasing amount of pCMV5 complexin-1 0 to 4-fold. Cell lysates were analyzed either directly by quantitative immunoblotting for SNARE complexes; high molecular mass bands  , or were first boiled for 20 min at 100°C for total SNARE proteins  , complexin-1  , Syt1  , and emerald.Thus  , in this system  , structure does not beget function. In dystrophic zebrafish  , we find that NAD+ supplementation improves both muscle structure and mobility  , but paxillin overexpression only improves muscle structure.We found a huge variability in cryptochrome number and identity throughout the different animal phyla. 2.One is that the subcellular localization of paxillin to MTJs is critical for paxillin function: paxillin localization is disrupted in dag1 morphants  , but not in itga6 or itga7 morphants. There are at least three possible explanations for why Itga6 and Itga7  , but not Dag1  , are required for paxillin overexpression-mediated restoration of muscle structure.One of the advantages of using a “4D” system such as muscle development in vivo is the depth of dynamic range that cells exhibit in response to changes in cell signaling  , cell adhesion  , and the biophysics of the surrounding microenvironment. Our data highlight the contribution of the Nrk2b-NAD+-laminin-paxillin-Itga6/Itga7 to cellular adaptive responses and suggest that this pathway may have therapeutic potential.Depending upon context  , paxillin potentiates either the assembly or disassembly of cell-ECM adhesion complexes. Paxillin is an essential signaling nexus that regulates cell adhesion  , morphology  , and migration 59.Another scenario that would explain these results is that paxillin modulates “inside-out” signaling via Itga6 and Itga7. Overexpression of paxillin restores localization of paxillin to MTJs in dag1 morphants and reduces dystrophy.The JNK pathway has recently been shown to have a role in Paxillin regulation during fibroblast migrations triggered by in vitro scratch wounds 17  , and so expression of Map4k4 is also suggestive of a cell migratory regulatory role for this signaling pathway in keratinocytes and fibroblasts during in vivo repair. The temporal profile Figure 4i and expression of Map4k4  , in both keratinocytes up to 10-12 cell diameters from the wound edge and a subset of dermal fibroblasts extending a similar distance back from the wound edge Figure 4j  , confirms the activation of this intracellular signaling cascade at sites of tissue repair.Cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 2 mM CaCl2  , and lysates were immunoblotted for Syt1  , Cpx1  , emerald  , SNARE complexes  , and total SNARE proteins A  , followed by quantitation using phosphoimager detection B. A & B. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid-expressing syntaxin-1a Synt-1  , SNAP-25  , synaptobrevin-2 Syb-2  , and complexin-1 Cpx1 in a constant 1:1:1:3 ratio  , together with an increasing amount of Syt1 expression plasmid 0 to 4-fold and a decreasing amount of emerald expression plasmid GFP; 4 to 0-fold to balance the total DNA amount.Seventy-two hours after transfection  , cells were plated on 3 μg/ml fibronection FN for 20 to 30 minutes  , and TIRF time-lapse microscopy was performed. BT-549 cells were transfected with siRNA siLuc or siSTAT5b  , GFP-speckle-actin  , and mKO-paxillin.Our results suggest that Dag1  , but not Itga6 or Itga7  , is required for localization of paxillin to the MTJ and that the beneficial effects of overexpressing paxillin in Dag1-deficient muscle tissue may result from increasing the amount of MTJ-proximal paxillin involved in inside-out signaling via integrin receptors for laminin. As paxillin is an integrin adaptor protein  , it is perhaps not surprising that paxillin-mediated BM augmentation requires functional integrin receptors for laminin.MAPK activity was dose-dependently inhibited by UO126  , which also reduced significantly the level of pSer83 paxillin Figure 7A–B. Since paxillin is a direct phosphorylation Ser83 target of ERK in innermedullary collecting duct cells 25  , we first studied the effect of chemical MEK-inhibition on pPaxillin in a ureteric bud derived cell line 42.Exogenous NAD+ or Emergen-C not shown significantly reduced the escape times of both dag1 and itga7 morphants. G Average escape response times of 2 dpf dystrophic zebrafish after exogenous NAD+ treatment or overexpression of paxillin.Interestingly  , paxillin and another FA protein  , vinculin  , are found also in adherens junctions AJ  , where they associate with β-catenin to modulate adhesion at sites of cell-cell contact 26  , 27. Either disruption of ERK/paxillin complex or lack of ERK induced phosphorylation on serine 83 abolishes cell spreading and branching morphogenesis 24  , 25.J Paxillin overexpression does not affect fiber detachment frequency in itga7 morphants. Fiber detachment is readily observed in itga7 morphants H and itga7 morphants transgenically overexpressing paxillin I  , white arrowheads.Here we show that overexpression of paxillin in dag1 morphants increases organization of laminin-111 at the MTJ and reduces dystrophy. The robust concentration of paxillin at MTJs during muscle development suggested a role for paxillin in maintaining muscle structure 60.Paxillin:GFP accounted for approximately 66.05%±8% of total paxillin expressed at 2 dpf in Tg:paxillin:GFP embryos unpublished data. Next  , we overexpressed paxillin in dag1 morphants by injecting dag1 MOs into Tg:paxillin:GFP embryos.Primary human GB cells immunostained for focal adhesion proteins vinculin and paxillin. Mature focal adhesions have a larger area and are responsible for remodeling the extracellular matrix during migration.The exocyst traffics vesicles to subdomains within the membrane and is critical for efficient exocytosis of integrins. Finally  , paxillin could be required to recruit the exocyst to the MTJ.Paxillin concentration at the MTJ was slightly disrupted in dag1 morphants at 26 hpf Figure 6B. We asked whether overexpression of paxillin would be sufficient to augment MTJ BM organization in dystrophic embryos.Embryos stably overexpressing paxillin fused to GFP were obtained from pairwise spawnings of carriers from the F1 generation of the Tg:paxillin:GFP line described in 27. Embryos were kept at 28.5°C in ERM and staged according to 71.Overexpression of paxillin restores localization of paxillin to MTJs in dag1 morphants and reduces dystrophy. One is that the subcellular localization of paxillin to MTJs is critical for paxillin function: paxillin localization is disrupted in dag1 morphants  , but not in itga6 or itga7 morphants.33 demonstrated that 32 repressive histone effector domains could be conditionally targeted to a genomic locus via the light sensitive cryptochrome 2 CRY2 protein and its interacting partner CIB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana 33. Konermann et al.Prior to the two vertebrate specific WGDs we found species with no cryptochrome Ciona intestinalis  , leech  , some mites  , one scorpions and some insects  , two some mites and insects  , or three crys cephalochordates  , echinodermates  , mollusks  , spiders  , and some insects. 1A  , B and 2.Our data highlight the contribution of the Nrk2b-NAD+-laminin-paxillin-Itga6/Itga7 to cellular adaptive responses and suggest that this pathway may have therapeutic potential. Taken together  , these data suggest that two out of three receptors are required in order to sufficiently bind laminin and increase ECM organization.Focal adhesions were stained with an antibody against vinculin and paxillin  , cytoskeletal proteins that are part of focal adhesions that also regulate mechanical coupling of the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix ECM. To assess the possibility that NKCC1 may affect GB cell migration through a mechanism other than cell volume regulation  , we compared the size of focal adhesions formed by NKCC1 knockdown cells and cells transduced with the control shRNA.Indeed  , less than half of non-septated rlc1Δ and pxl1Δ cells were monopolar Figure 6C  , and the monopolar septated percentages of these genotypes were more similar to wild-type percentages than were those of the other mutants examined Figure 6D. Of note  , deletion of rlc1 or paxillin pxl1  , which function primarily in early actomyosin function at the CR 47  , 48  , 57  , 58  , did not alter growth polarity percentages as significantly as other mutations or deletions Figure 6C–6D and Figure S5A.It will be very interesting to determine the mechanisms of action and elucidate why paxillin—one of a thousand focal adhesion proteins—plays such a critical role. Our results clearly show that MTJ-localized paxillin is sufficient to impact local organization of the ECM microenvironment.We analyzed both the subcellular localization of paxillin upon Itga6 or Itga7 knockdown as well as the ability of transgenic paxillin overexpression to rescue the muscle defects observed in itga6 or itga7 morphants. As paxillin does not require Dag1 for BM augmentation-mediated reduction of dystrophy Figure 6  , we asked whether integrin receptors are required.Zebrafish deficient for Dag1 display progressive muscle atrophy 30. Taken together  , these results suggest manipulation of NAD+ precursors/biosynthetic enzymes and paxillin as new potential therapeutic approaches for treatment of not only muscle diseases but also diseases/syndromes that affect laminin integrity.Circadian rhythms of Per1 expression have been reported in the rat and mouse retina 41 ,42. Circadian clocks in mammalian tissues generate molecular circadian rhythms through coupled transcription/translation feedback loops in which the positive gene elements Clock and Bmal1 interact with the negative gene elements Period Per 1 and 2  , and Cryptochrome Cry 1 and 2  , and in which casein kinases  , CKIɛ and CKIδ  , set circadian period by phosphorylating PER proteins to regulate their degradation and nuclear localization 38 ,40.However  , given that the reduction in muscle degeneration is similar in NAD+-supplemented  , Emergen-C-supplemented  , and paxillin-overexpressing dag1 morphants  , it seems unlikely that other vitamins are causing this effect. Clearly  , vitamins other than niacin in the packets could contribute to the reduction of dystrophy.This particular study was not focused on identifying the epigenetic properties of the chromatin modifiers  , but this technique holds potential as a toolkit that can provide high temporal resolution with which to study epigenetic mechanisms and identify epigenetic factors 114. 33 demonstrated that 32 repressive histone effector domains could be conditionally targeted to a genomic locus via the light sensitive cryptochrome 2 CRY2 protein and its interacting partner CIB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana 33.Map4k4  , a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family that activates the JNK and MAPK signaling pathways in response to stress signals  , cytokines and growth factors 16  , is a member of the early effector cluster. The JNK pathway has recently been shown to have a role in Paxillin regulation during fibroblast migrations triggered by in vitro scratch wounds 17  , and so expression of Map4k4 is also suggestive of a cell migratory regulatory role for this signaling pathway in keratinocytes and fibroblasts during in vivo repair.a Lysates from FAKwt/wt and FAKflx/flx/MMTV-NIC end-stage mammary tumours were immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. Figure showing that focal adhesion kinase FAK-ablated tumours show reduced levels of tyrosine phosphorylated p130Cas and Paxillin.As paxillin does not require Dag1 for BM augmentation-mediated reduction of dystrophy Figure 6  , we asked whether integrin receptors are required. Our results suggest that Dag1  , but not Itga6 or Itga7  , is required for localization of paxillin to the MTJ and that the beneficial effects of overexpressing paxillin in Dag1-deficient muscle tissue may result from increasing the amount of MTJ-proximal paxillin involved in inside-out signaling via integrin receptors for laminin.WGD events and subsequent loss of some paralogous genes in the vertebrate lineage have shaped the Cryptochrome family in each vertebrate lineage. Based on our phylogeny  , we hypothesize that in ancestral Bilateria three Cryptochromes Cry1/2/3  , Cry4/5  , and Cry6 built the basis for all currently known family members.UB cells were cultured in DMEM/10%FBS/Glutamax/penicillin-streptomycin media. Rabbit anti-pErk1/2 Cell Signaling  , 1∶2000  , anti-ERK2 K-23  , Sant Cruz  , 1∶1000  , pS83 paxillin ECM Biosciences  , 1∶1000 and mouse paxillin ECM Biosciences  , 1∶1000 were used with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies to detect proteins which were visualized by Pierce ECL Western Blotting detection system Thermo Scientific and Fuji film LAS1000.As paxillin is ubiquitously expressed and necessary for early development 62 ,63  , understanding how paxillin improves laminin organization in dag1 morphants may provide insight into paxillin function in other tissues as well. It will be very interesting to determine the mechanisms of action and elucidate why paxillin—one of a thousand focal adhesion proteins—plays such a critical role.Consistent with reduction in c-Src activation and p130Cas-initiated signaling  , the FAK-deficient ErbB2 tumour cells exhibited a proliferative defect relative to their FAK-proficient counterparts Figure S2a in Additional file 2. Concomitant with abolition of FAK protein  , we noted a significant reduction in the levels of phosphorylated c-Src  , Paxillin and p130Cas Figure 4a.Here we have studied the in vivo functions of MAPK pathway during renal branching by deleting Mek1
30 specifically in UB epithelium in Mek2 -null background 31. The MAPK pathway appears to contribute to UB branching guidance by carrying out dual functions; it regulates G1/S-phase transition during cell cycle progression  , and epithelial cell adhesion through paxillin phosphorylation affecting FA and AJ dynamics.We found that Nicotinamide riboside kinase 2b Nrk2b Q7ZUR6_DANRE-mediated NAD+ synthesis potentiates laminin polymerization and subcellular localization of paxillin Q6R3L1_DANRE  , an integrin-associated adaptor protein 27. We have identified a novel cell adhesion pathway required for laminin polymerization at the MTJ in vivo.C NAD+ rescues the disrupted concentration of paxillin at the MTJ in dag1 morphants white arrows. B Paxillin is less concentrated at the MTJ in dag1 morphants white arrowheads.Paxillin overexpression is also sufficient to restore laminin organization in dystrophic zebrafish. As paxillin is ubiquitously expressed and necessary for early development 62 ,63  , understanding how paxillin improves laminin organization in dag1 morphants may provide insight into paxillin function in other tissues as well.Our data show that laminin polymerization is necessary and sufficient for muscle fiber homeostasis and that NAD+ and paxillin increase laminin polymerization. H Model of cell adhesion at the MTJ.Thus  , likely through “inside-out” signaling via laminin receptors  , paxillin is sufficient to affect the ECM microenvironment. We previously showed that the integrin-associated adaptor protein paxillin functions downstream of Nrk2b-mediated NAD+ synthesis during MTJ development: paxillin overexpression is sufficient to rescue MTJ morphogenesis in nrk2b morphants 27.This makes them an interesting lineage to study Cryptochrome evolution and phylogeny. 2.It is very interesting that paxillin overexpression does not rescue morphogenesis/reduce dystrophy in itga6 or itga7 morphants. These results clearly implicate paxillin in playing a fundamental role in muscle homeostasis.Paxillin also localized to the MTJ in itga7 morphants Figure 7G  , and paxillin overexpression in itga7 morphants had no effect on the percent of myotomes per embryo with dystrophic lesions Figure 7H–J; p = 0.9. Paxillin overexpression in itga6 morphants Figure 7E did not reduce the incidence of MTJ failure Figure 7C; p = 0.18.All membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies Jackson immunoresearch Laboratories  , West Grove  , PA  , USA and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence GE Healthcare Life Sciences  , Baie d'Urfé  , QC  , Canada. Phospho-p130Cas 4011  , AKT 9272  , phospho-AKT 9271  , ERK1/2 9102  , phospho-ERK1/2 9106  , phospho-c-Src 2101  , and phospho-Paxillin 2541 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling.We previously showed that the integrin-associated adaptor protein paxillin functions downstream of Nrk2b-mediated NAD+ synthesis during MTJ development: paxillin overexpression is sufficient to rescue MTJ morphogenesis in nrk2b morphants 27. Paxillin overexpression also significantly reduced the incidence of fiber detachment in 3 dpf Dag1-deficient embryos Figure 6F–H; *p<0.05.For example  , ILK acts as a scaffold protein to allow for protein-complex formations connecting extracellular integrin signals to intracellular actin cytoskeleton rearrangements through direct interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrin 4. Through interactions with a diverse range of proteins including adapters such as particularly interesting Cys-His-rich protein PINCH  , calponin homology-containing ILK-binding protein CH-ILKBP  , affixin and paxillin  , kinases such as integrin-linked kinase-associated serine/threonine phosphatase 2C ILKAP  , protein kinase B AKT and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 PDK-1  , and transmembrane receptors such as β1 and β3 integrins 1  , ILK is thought to play a key role in integrin and growth factor receptor related signaling cascades 2 ,3.It has been proposed that other CRY2 alleles affect flowering in a wide range of accessions  , but experimental data supporting this suggestion are still lacking 15. Similarly  , the EDI EARLY DAY-LENGTH INSENSITIVE allele of the photoreceptor CRY2 CRYPTOCHROME 2 causes early flowering under short days  , but appears to be restricted to accessions from the Cape Verde Islands 14.The robust concentration of paxillin at MTJs during muscle development suggested a role for paxillin in maintaining muscle structure 60. Depending upon context  , paxillin potentiates either the assembly or disassembly of cell-ECM adhesion complexes.Finally  , we show that NAD+ plays a dual role in ameliorating dystrophy: NAD+-mediated paxillin clustering improves muscle structure and adhesion  , but NAD+ acts independently of paxillin to improve motility. Pseudo-genetic epistasis experiments show that either Dag1 or Itga7 is required with Itga6 for the effects of exogenous NAD+ on reduction of dystrophy.For Syt1 titration experiments  , HEK293T cells were cotransfected as above  , except that pCMV5 complexin-1 was replaced with pCMV5 Syt1. Total DNA was kept constant by balancing the complexin-1 plasmid with pCMV5 emerald 4 to 0-fold.For Syt1 titration experiments in presence of complexin-1  , cells were solubilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS with or without addition of 2 mM CaCl2  , supplemented with protease inhibitors Roche. Two days after transfection  , cells were harvested by solubilization for 1h at 4°C in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS  , supplemented with protease inhibitors Roche.b Quantification using ImageJ software of the immunoblots shown in a for total p130Cas and Paxillin  , normalized to cytokeratin 8 CK8 control for epithelial content. β-actin was used as loading control.In dystrophic zebrafish  , we find that NAD+ supplementation improves both muscle structure and mobility  , but paxillin overexpression only improves muscle structure. Along with muscle degeneration  , CMDs can also present with joint and skeletal deformities and mental retardation.Immunodetection of paxillin was conducted using preparations from 2 dpf embryos as previously described 27. Band intensities were quantified in NIH Image J http://lukemiller.org/journal/2007/08/quantifying-western-blots-without.html.The experiments shown here were undertaken because we had previously shown that Nrk2b-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis is necessary for laminin organization during myotendinous junction development. However  , given that the reduction in muscle degeneration is similar in NAD+-supplemented  , Emergen-C-supplemented  , and paxillin-overexpressing dag1 morphants  , it seems unlikely that other vitamins are causing this effect.However  , the function and the activation status of PKD1 in this complex are not known. In some breast cancer cells  , PKD forms a complex with cortactin and paxillin  , which are both associated with invadopodia membranes 4.Paxillin overexpression was sufficient to improve laminin organization and significantly reduce muscle defects in dag1 morphants. The intracellular cell-ECM adhesion protein paxillin is downstream of Nrk2b-mediated NAD+ synthesis during MTJ development 27.A–F Individual panels from videos of escape responses after a touch stimulus at 2 dpf; time in milliseconds is denoted on panels. We hypothesize that NAD+  , through mediating paxillin concentration at MTJs  , invokes “inside-out” signaling through laminin receptors that results in increased laminin polymerization.We hypothesize that NAD+  , through mediating paxillin concentration at MTJs  , invokes “inside-out” signaling through laminin receptors that results in increased laminin polymerization. We find that Dag1 and Nrk2b are required for paxillin localization to the MTJ.Fiber detachment is readily observed in itga7 morphants H and itga7 morphants transgenically overexpressing paxillin I  , white arrowheads. H–I Side mounted  , anterior left  , dorsal top  , 4 dpf embryos stained with phalloidin white.HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid expressing Synt-1  , SNAP-25  , Syb-2  , and complexin-1 in a 1:1:1:3 ratio  , together with an increasing amount of Syt1 expression plasmid 0 to 4-fold  , and decreasing amount of emerald expression plasmid GFP; 4 to 0-fold. Syt1 increases SNARE complex assembly in presence of complexin-1.Paxillin binding to an exocyst component  , Sec5  , mediates proper subcellular localization of exocyst complexes 61. The exocyst traffics vesicles to subdomains within the membrane and is critical for efficient exocytosis of integrins.Western blotting was done as previously described 60. For paxillin phosphorylation  , UB cells were serum-starved for 4 h and followed by fetal bovine serum FBS treatment of indicated times and 15 µM UO126 was used for inhibiting MAPK activity 30 min prior plus during the induction with FBS.
