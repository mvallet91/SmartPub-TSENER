1997 to fit our experimental data demonstrates that the GVMAG dimerization interface is more equivalent to αIIb-W968/VLVG and β3-V696/LLSV see Materials and Methods. However  , the use of the glycophorin template MacKenzie et al.To assess the respective transcriptional activities of hGATA-1  , hGATA-1Rb−  , and hGATA-1s  , we performed transient transfection assays in NIH-3T3 cells using a luciferase reporter gene driven by several minimal erythroid-specific promoters that included 1 the erythroid porphobilinogene deaminase promoter nucleotides −714 to +78 PBGD 42  , 2 the glycophorin-B promoter −95GpB 43  , 3 the erythropoietin receptor promoter −58  , +43 Epo-R 44  , 4 the 3XGATA-TK synthetic promoter 45  , and 5 the GATA-1 proximal promoter IE together with its upstream enhancer element IE3.9int 46. hGATA-1 and hGATA-1Rb

proteins have undistinguishable transcriptional activity.For example  , DNA binding of the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer is responsible for the downregulation of glycoprotein glycophorin B in non erythroid cells 38. Ku proteins modulate transcription by several mechanisms and these properties seem to be gene and cell specific.The current model for SPB linkage posits that at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope  , Sfi1 forms protein dimers that span the entire bridge to mediate SPB cohesion 17  , 18. Recent studies have shown that Sfi1 is a target of both Cdk1 and Cdc5  , and phosphorylation of Sfi1 plays a critical role in both SPB duplication and separation 15  , 16.This suggests that Cdk1 and Cdc14 phosphoregulation of Sfi1 contribute to licensing of SPB duplication whereby mitotic Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 blocks and Cdc14 dephosphorylation enables SPB duplication. Interestingly  , Sfi1 has been shown to be phosphorylated at numerous sites within C-terminal Cdk1 consensus motifs in vivo
11  , 21 and in vitro by Cdk1 14 and to be dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase Cdc14 14  , 20  , which is required for mitotic exit 22  , 23.In contrast  , Ku binding to apolipoprotein C-IV promoter stimulates the expression of the gene 39. For example  , DNA binding of the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer is responsible for the downregulation of glycoprotein glycophorin B in non erythroid cells 38.We find that the 3'UTR of β-catenin mRNA is sufficient to direct protein expression to the axon. We find that Netrin-1 induces β-catenin mediated transcriptional activity in thalamic cells and induces rapid changes in the growth cone levels of β-catenin protein.Together with the actions from Cdc31 and Kar1  , Sfi1 tethers duplicated SPBs to generate a side-by-side SPB configuration Fig 1A. The current model for SPB linkage posits that at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope  , Sfi1 forms protein dimers that span the entire bridge to mediate SPB cohesion 17  , 18.cDNA fragments were cloned in Sfi1 sites of pAcTMVSVG vector providing N-terminal fusion with the gp64 signal peptide and C-terminal fusion with the transmembrane TM and cytoplasmic terminal domains CTD of the VSV G protein. Construction of the display library.Neurite branching is also patterned by inhibitory signals. For example  , locally applied nerve growth factor NGF or Netrin-1 induce de novo interstitial branch formation in cultured cortical neurons 2  , 3.Sfi1 residues 800 to 946 were amplified via PCR and cloned into the pKLD116 plasmid gift of Ivan Rayment immediately downstream of the rTEV site and in frame with the N-terminal 6×His and maltose binding protein tags. An in vitro kinase reaction was performed using 1 µg of the Sfi1 C terminus fusion protein 6×His-MBP-rTEVsite-Sfi1C  , 1 mM ATP  , and Clb2 purified from bacteria/Cdc28 purified from baculovirus co-infected with the Cdk activating kinase CAK 8.The resulting plasmid was transformed into C+ DE3 competent E. coli cells gift of Greg Odorizzi. Sfi1 residues 800 to 946 were amplified via PCR and cloned into the pKLD116 plasmid gift of Ivan Rayment immediately downstream of the rTEV site and in frame with the N-terminal 6×His and maltose binding protein tags.Currently unknown is whether protein cleavage is required for yeast centrosome separation. There are four known half-bridge components; three of them  , Sfi1 called hSfi1 in human 5  , Cdc31 called centrin in animals7 and Kar18  , localize to the cytoplasmic side of the bridge  , whereas Mps3 localizes to the nuclear side 9  , 10.1997 that minimized the distances between residues with more than 80% cross-linking efficiency see Materials and Methods. For comparisons  , we used our cross-linking data to construct a model by selecting an alignment to the glycophorin A TM homodimer NMR structure Mac-Kenzie et al.These assays were designed to test the hypothesis that the Gly-Val-Met-Ala-Gly GVMAG homodimerization motif in glycophorin is equivalent to G972/VLGG in αIIb and S699/VMGA in β3 Schneider and Engelman 2003. However  , the chimeras that were assayed contain truncated integrin TM domains with only 17 residues of the α and β subunit TM domains  , lack the GFFKR motif demonstrated here to be required for physiologic TM domain association  , and insert as type II rather than type I membrane proteins.Phosphorylated peptides were identified by manual inspection of all MS/MS spectra with Mascot ions scores of at least 20. Spectra were searched using Mascot v2.2 Matrix Science against a small custom database with the protein sequence of the recombinant Sfi1 fusion protein included.Consistent with this  , studies on dimerization of the glycophorin A TM domains have shown that cysteine substitutions are on average less disrupting than substitutions with any other hydrophobic residue Lemmon et al. Furthermore  , none of the ten β3 or 12 αIIb single-cysteine mutants studied here showed elevated ligand binding activity data not shown.These different plasmids were cotransfected with the “empty” Migr plasmid or with Migr-derived plasmids expressing hGATA-1  , hGATA-1Rb−  , or hGATA-1s. To assess the respective transcriptional activities of hGATA-1  , hGATA-1Rb−  , and hGATA-1s  , we performed transient transfection assays in NIH-3T3 cells using a luciferase reporter gene driven by several minimal erythroid-specific promoters that included 1 the erythroid porphobilinogene deaminase promoter nucleotides −714 to +78 PBGD 42  , 2 the glycophorin-B promoter −95GpB 43  , 3 the erythropoietin receptor promoter −58  , +43 Epo-R 44  , 4 the 3XGATA-TK synthetic promoter 45  , and 5 the GATA-1 proximal promoter IE together with its upstream enhancer element IE3.9int 46.For example  , locally applied nerve growth factor NGF or Netrin-1 induce de novo interstitial branch formation in cultured cortical neurons 2  , 3. In addition  , diffusible  , secreted cues also regulate neurite branching.For comparisons  , we used our cross-linking data to construct a model by selecting an alignment to the glycophorin A TM homodimer NMR structure Mac-Kenzie et al. 2002.A key finding in this study is the rapid increase in the levels of β-catenin protein in thalamic growth cones in response to the axon guidance cue Netrin-1. Therefore  , while we have not directly addressed whether or not β-catenin is locally translated in thalamic growth cones in the present study  , our finding that β-catenin mRNA is present in thalamic axons and that elements in its 3'UTR assist protein expression in the thalamic axonal compartment make it a strong possibility.Spectra were searched using Mascot v2.2 Matrix Science against a small custom database with the protein sequence of the recombinant Sfi1 fusion protein included. Peptides were eluted with a gradient from 8% acetonitrile  , 0.1% formic acid to 32% acetonitrile  , 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.For each condition values represent means for n = 84-95 growth cones randomly selected from 3 independent cultures each including thalamic tissue from several embryos Students t-test p values for ± Netrin-1 comparion indicated above histogram bars at each time-point. F Growth cone β-catenin staining pixel intensity measured after 10 minutes  , 1 hour  , or 24 hours exposure to Netrin-1 expressed relative to untreated controls.hGATA-1 and hGATA-1Rb

With respect to hGATA-1s  , the Epo-R minimal erythroid pEpoR and the GATA-1 IE3.9int promoters were activated at a lower level approximately 50%  , whereas the erythroid porphobilinogene deaminase promoter was not activated  , and both the glycophorin-B −95GpB and the synthetic 3XGATA-TK promoters were equally transactivated.Identification of phosphorylated residues from two replicate mass spectrometry runs of in vitro phosphorylated recombinant Sfi1 C terminus fusion protein by Clb2/Cdk1. B.An in vitro kinase reaction was performed using 1 µg of the Sfi1 C terminus fusion protein 6×His-MBP-rTEVsite-Sfi1C  , 1 mM ATP  , and Clb2 purified from bacteria/Cdc28 purified from baculovirus co-infected with the Cdk activating kinase CAK 8. The sample was flash frozen  , treated with lysozyme  , sonicated  , and column purification using Talon metal affinity resin Clontech Laboratories  , Inc. was performed using 200 mM imidazole for elution.Ter119 expression increases as maturation of erythrocyte progresses 21  , 22. Erythroid cells at different developmental stages can be identified by different cell surface markers: Ter119 erythroid specific glycophorin and CD71 the transferrin receptor.1992 under conditions similar to those under which integrin TM domains fail to heterodimerize  , it has been proposed that the interaction between the integrin TM domains is less stable Gottschalk et al. Since glycophorin A TM domains dimerize in lipid and detergent micelles Lemmon et al.Models for clusters 11 and 12 were kindly provided by the authors of Gottschalk et al. The alignment where αIIb sequence W968/VLVG and β3 sequence V696/LLSV were aligned with glycophorin A sequence G79/VMAG in each monomer gave the lowest root mean square distance 4.8 Å and thus was chosen as the final model.Since glycophorin A TM domains dimerize in lipid and detergent micelles Lemmon et al. 2001 or lipid bilayers  , and association between the TM domains has never been demonstrated in intact cells.The chimeric genes were expressed under the control of polyhedrin promoter and terminator. cDNA fragments were cloned in Sfi1 sites of pAcTMVSVG vector providing N-terminal fusion with the gp64 signal peptide and C-terminal fusion with the transmembrane TM and cytoplasmic terminal domains CTD of the VSV G protein.With respect to hGATA-1s  , the Epo-R minimal erythroid pEpoR and the GATA-1 IE3.9int promoters were activated at a lower level approximately 50%  , whereas the erythroid porphobilinogene deaminase promoter was not activated  , and both the glycophorin-B −95GpB and the synthetic 3XGATA-TK promoters were equally transactivated. No difference in the transcriptional activity of hGATA-1 and hGATA-1Rb− was detected with these promoters.The alignment where αIIb sequence W968/VLVG and β3 sequence V696/LLSV were aligned with glycophorin A sequence G79/VMAG in each monomer gave the lowest root mean square distance 4.8 Å and thus was chosen as the final model. For each model  , the average Cβ–Cβ or Cβ–Gly Cα atom distance between residues that formed disulfides at greater than 80% efficiency Trp968–Val696  , Val969–Val696  , Val971–Leu697  , Gly972–Leu697  , and Gly972–Val700 was calculated.Erythroid cells at different developmental stages can be identified by different cell surface markers: Ter119 erythroid specific glycophorin and CD71 the transferrin receptor.
