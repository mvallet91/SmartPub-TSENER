TSE-NER

The main goal of TSE-NER is to (1) Generate training data for long-tail entities and train a NER tagger, 
(2) label entities in text (documents), and (3) use named entities in documents for search and exploration.

Therefore in this repository we provide the code used for each one of the 3 main modules:

Module 1: NER Training
This first module provides with the environment for anyone interested to train a NER model (Stanford NER) 
for the labelling of long-tail entities, for example datasets used in scientific publications: 
“...in this work, we benchmark our algorithm using the ImageNet corpus...”.

Additionally, we are working on an API for interested users to train their own models for new types of 
long-tail entities. 

Module 2: NER Labelling
