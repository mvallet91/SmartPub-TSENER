OVERVIEW
The increased use of interactive features in digital libraries (DLs) in recent years have enabled users to be not only consumers of the DL content, but also producers, who oftentimes generate voluminous textual reviews of DL items.
To the best of our knowledge   , the literature on active learning in recommender systems focuses on explicit feedback 15 .
We obtain our F = 4096 dimensional visual features by taking the output of the second fully-connected layer i.e.
This has not been our experience.

The modulation representation is obtained by taking the magnitude of this complex-valued output.
Broadly speaking   , the participants found the interaction fairly simple   , and the visualization metaphor clear: tags represent photos taken by Flickr users.
It contained 17,777 users, 10,000 tags and 4,520,212 resources connected by 34,505,061 TAS.
We have used the above methodology for recommending movie in IMDB database.
We can see that our approach has achieved significant improvement compared with the other two approaches.
It remains possible that users viewed their recommendations without rating any content; however   , given this uncertainty in the data   , we only consider the scenario where there is evidence that the users have interacted with the system.
The selection was done by using a stratified random sample on the movie popularity curve: we divided the 500   , 000 Netflix movies into 10 equal-density bins and random sampled 10 movies from each bin.

The average query processing time for the query load is 2.4 seconds.
Importantly, the Repositive platform holds descriptions and metadata but does not store the data itself: the user can click through to the source for data access.Given the facts that there is no single standard that all repositories follow, that different ontologies are used by different repositories, and that metadata annotations are provided to different levels of detail, locating and indexing data from existing repositories turns out to be a challenging task.To address the problem of varying quality and type of metadata associated with data in public repositories, the Repositive platform allows users to comment on the content and quality of datasets and add descriptions to the listed metadata.
This is the main motivation for introducing an adaptive teleportation process into the standard random walk for better voting.

The case of Rotten Tomatoes is smaller but includes more than 80 thousand movies rated by the users of the platform we discard professional critic data.
For example   , knowing when people posted images about Hurricane Katrina to Flickr   , and with what tags   , is useful   , but seeing the images has another value 13.
Since information related to most frequent queries on Flickr is not publicly available   , we use a subset of frequent tags in Flickr 5 as a proxy for single-tag queries.
We then created a set of X shared objects at random based on the representative distribution given by the 2410 objects from IMDb.
This layer of user account federation also ensures that multiple third-party applications can securely read and write data to the iPlant Data Store on behalf of users.

It allows users to upload their photos and freely annotate them.
Following the experiment setting of 3   , we pick the 5-star ratings for Netflix and 80 or higher ratings for Yahoo!
Flickr: On Flickr   , the entities to be tagged are pictures.
Figure 5 shows the performance of content-based classifiers within co-training on the validation set.
The models are then run on the residual corpus to produce final ranked lists.
After washing in PBS-T three times, the samples were incubated in 1:200 biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) at 25°C for one day.
Therefore, for applications in which recall in the top tuples is important it is best to stick to lower values of parameters F and G at the cost of increased execution time.
The proposed model is based on language model that incorporates this a priori knowledge.
It consists of a geo-tagged photograph database   , and modules for search   , clustering   , tag cloud generation and visualization.
Example systems include YouTube 8   , Flickr 3 and Digg 2  Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee IW3C2.
The Lyrics dataset contains five tables   , such as artists   , albums and songs   , with around 400  ,000 records.
The experiments were conducted on three datasets: two standard TREC datasets   , and one Wikipedia dataset for federated search based on the ClueWeb.
The second is the Internet Movie Database IMDB 2 .
We have taken a random snapshot of Flickr consisting of 52 million photos to analyse how users tag their photos and what type of tags they are provid- ing.
We present characteristics of the Flickr social network that are relevant to information propagation in Section 3.
There has been a large volume of work on document summarization in the last several decades.
There are two main differences to REF:  Entities are not represented by their homepages   , but by a unique URI from a specific collection   , a sample of the Linked Open Data cloud.
Key to enriching the search experience is the wide-scale availability of user-generated content and other knowledge bases such as Wikipedia   , the Internet Movie Database IMDB   , GeoPlanet TM    , or Freebase to name a few.

They rated information discovery features (up to 10 times) higher than DSpace users.
In some lineages (cf.
The IMDb also has the possibility to add soundtrack listings to a movie.
We investigate two methods of imputing the ratings: a user independent method   , where all the missing ratings are filled in by the same value   , and a user dependent method   , where for every user n the missing ratings are predicted by a probabilistic matrix factorization model PMF 24.
Similarly   , if one wishes to perform collaborative filtering on data from sites such as Amazon or NetFlix   , the algorithms need to scale to tens of millions of users.
In summary   , the Flickr social structure exhibits properties that promise wide-spread dissemination of popular information throughout the network.
A list of the binary pairs with significant age-dependent transcriptional co-regulation is shown in Table S4.Distribution of transcriptional expression correlations for binary protein interaction pairs in the longevity network is shown in black.
These posts, and users' responses to them, act as in-place community refinements to the tutorial content.
The presenter is responsible for two types of permissions:

The source of reviews may be further investigated: we may choose to re-weight the sources   , as we re-weighted authors for the Netflix data.
We first describe the small-world pattern seen in the Flickr network topology   , which is characterized by a strong local clustering and a small diameter.
We also took IMDB Internet Movie DataBase 11 into consideration as input.
Meta-data is provided for all training images and videos   , including their geo-location as well as the accuracy with which they were geo-tagged.
First, we defined tag clusters (TCs) from transcripts and several tag-based resources.
as being in some sense 'their' videos   , in that the students could access the videos for reviewing .
Thus tag based image retrieval is very popular and practical in the searching engines such as Flickr.
They studied Flickr and also found that the social network played a significant role in photo propagation.
Human judgement was used in many previous works on automatic ontology construction   , e.g.
For comparison   , we applied our method for both classification and naming to full-texts for the categories of courses and faculty from the WebKB dataset.
Each ambience is associated with a set of tagged images.
In terms of purity   , rand index   , and precision   , there exists an inflection point around N f = 1000   , where optimal clustering results were achieved.

However, significant differences were observed for Pr(x|c-), the probability that a feature x appeared in the irrelevant articles, whose distributions are illustrated in Figure 1.
Error Bars are SEM.
We represented each Wikipedia personality wi from the candidate list as the Bagof-Words BOWwi of the first paragraph of his/her Wikipedia profile.
Our first observation is that   , as expected   , the performance is gradually improved i.e.
Examples of configuration information are user ID for Flickr service and API key for Google Maps.
Based on the report that ELPs with different amino acid content showed a similar levels of adsorption , we numerically estimated the saturated surface density of 20-adsorbed substrates (Figure 3C).

We then describe the process of collection of the aesthetics scores through crowdsourcing  §4.
Examples include Pinterest boards, blogs, and even collections of tweets.
Notably, the Flickr Commons (flickr.com/commons) on the photo-sharing website Flickr.com allows cultural institutions to post digitized resources for public tagging, comment, annotation, and discussion.
Extensive experiments were conducted on the IMDB dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
For instance the Internet Movie Database IMDB 4 provides two different search fields referring to individuals   , one called  People  persons involved in the creation of a movie and one called  Character  name of the individual portrayed in a movie.
From the results it is seen that our recommendation is quite in agreement with IMDB recommendation.
Many of the photos uploaded by users are geotagged   , thereby providing a wealth of geospatial data.
Therefore   , running a large number of generated test cases would not be feasible.
Second   , we employ query segmentation i.e.
What incentives do aggregators have  ?
On the other hand   , mashup applications combine Web resources from more than one folksonomy based system into various integrated experience 11 .
We explored the more sophisticated measure of re-weighting  more reliable  authors as described earlier on the Netflix data.
We iterate over the user's click history and compute p × q MinHash values for this user.
Based on this database   , we created one document per movie that contained the relevant information about it e.g.
As the top ranked documents are mostly overlong   , the biase towards long documents in the document ranking could be so evident that the length distribution of relevant and non-relevant documents fits very well with the distribution functions on both training and testing topics.
This makes the collection provide an interesting mixture of short textual lists with quickly decreasing scores and longer lists of categorical values with a low skew and many score ties.
In terms of AP@5   , the two CCF models gain about 52.8%–53.6% improvements compared to the two CF models on the Social data   , and by 37.0%–37.8% on Netflix-5 star.
The highest risks of getting breast cancer are found among long-term users, current users, or estrogen–progestin users .
Note that there are other approaches to populate a database of expert ratings   , ranging from a manuallymaintained database of dedicated experts to the result of crawling and inferring quantitative ratings from online reviews .
Correspondingly the left side of browser contained a list called My Personal News.
Now, a LOD-based NER system (e.g.
An extensive set of experiments has been conducted with the federated search testbed of the Clueweb dataset to evaluate the proposed research.
The remaining independent variables were collected from the Flickr system.
The baseline can be assessed by input.

Two different magnifications show overview (Figure 4A, C or detail photograps (Figure 4B, D) of representative areas for both study groups.
To investigate our approach   , we need to consider a user's tweets for a substantial period of time as the average user does not take photos every day.
Variations of MF models are becoming very popular for their good performances on standard rating prediction tasks such as Netflix challenge.
3   , 4    , item recommendation from implicit feedback has started to get more into the focus 2   , 6   , 7.
etc.
Flickr has been used extensively in research   , in large part because it provides a public API that has allowed researchers to easily obtain large data-sets.
Movies all provide basic information—   , and that the related queries are interspersed with other searches   , making it difficult to see patterns.
For example, the 1-hop social neighborhood of location l would be composed of the individuals that visit location l, the 2-hop social neighborhood would be composed of the individuals that visit location l and their friends and so on.
Therefore   , we removed those experts who did not contain at least ρ ratings of the Netflix movies.
For each image    , the collection contains a thumbnail image   , a link to a corresponding entry at the Flickr web site   , user-specified metadata title   , GPS location   , tags   , comments   , etc.
The authors of 18 propose fast approximations of the original RWR method ensuring up to 90% or better quality   , which takes into account properties of social graphs   , namely linear correlations and community-like structure.
Finally, a proximity model applied to the Ad-hoc Web track is presented in Section 5.
Primer locations used for RT–PCR and qPCR of dsx are shown in relation to the dsx gene model.
For evaluating our methods   , we used WebKB datasets4 and these web pages crawled from these four universities' website are manually divided into seven classes   , such as students   , faculty   , staff   , department   , course   , project and others.
Top rated images tend to belong to a small set of owners and convey a lower semantic variety than the pictures from centrality-based rankings.
2009 found that much of the interaction on Flickr is localized and that users find the great majority 81-91% of their contacts within two network hops.
The unimpressive results of PR justify the assertion that it is too general for use in topic-driven tasks due to its minimal exploitation of the topic context 16   , 23.
The number of SVM iterations seem to scale up with the problem size   , unlike SIMPL.
The item-based model calculates similarities between each pair of movies based on the number of times movies co-occur in user baskets.
The work of Hollenstein and Purves 9 seeks to identify vernacular regions in Flickr 7 data.
Various external automatic and manual tools such as GPS synchronization   , other map applications and more can be used to update or input locations for photographs on Flickr.
In 19   , the authors suggest that for homogenous newswire collections a small window is enough to capture useful dependencies   , while for large   , noisy web collections   , a larger span must be set.
Finally, the in-house HMMs were included in a PfamA-style repository with their sequences and domain thresholds set to 25.0.STAND sequences were scanned using PfamA and in-house signatures.
National borders and computer software have a complicated history.
For subsequent Qi updates , increase the Count by one.
In Flickr   , users get a small number of updates about their friends' newly uploaded pictures when they log in.
Examples of such sets of items are products in a web-based store   , movies and actors on the website IMDB   , pages on wikis   , and the tags used to describe blog posts in the previous example.
Its difficult to predict how Flickr   , del.icio.us   , and other folksonomy-dependent sites will scale as content volume escalates.
We have to also consider that many entity queries could have very large answer sets e.g.
Hence   , among the three resources compared   , we conclude that Flickr is most suited for learning word2vec models for zero-shot image tagging.
To simulate content dissemination   , we need realistic graph datasets   , and models for content generation and propaga- tion.
This seems to be in line with the hypothesis formulated in 19   , for which dependence models may yield larger improvements for large collections.
The Movies table has 120  ,000 records with the information about movies   , including their ID   , title   , release year   , runtime   , IMDB rank   , and number of votes.
We exposed each subject to three experimental conditions: the Baseline browser with the subject's own, manually created photo organization (BM); the Baseline browser with the time cluster based organization that our system generated automatically (BA); and the Timeline browser (TL); also with the system generated organization.

Using this method, we believe we can achieve a detailed, granular, self-constructing user profile.
As a simple baseline   , we used a query-independent method by ranking resources based on their estimated size.
For the IMDB data set   , there are few large values with the majority of the scores being clustered toward the lower end of the value range for each attribute.
1c-d) of three-day-old seedlings that were germinated on moistened filter paper.
Flickr for example features 5.5 billion images as of January 31   , 2011 and around 3000-5000 images are added per minute.
S3, Supplementary Material online).
which are serial models originated from the basic Matrix Factorization MF model 1   , are augmented by integrating user and item biases   , implicit feedback of users   , and temporal effects respectively in calculating predicted ratings.
Therefore   , we propose novel uses of external sources of information as proxies for cluster validation: 1 ad hoc relevance; and 2 spam classification.
A probabilistic model for extracting low dimensional profiles is studies in 12    , in which latent variables are introduced to capture the users and items and the EM algorithm is used to estimate the parameters.
An essential adjunct to service discovery is service description, by which names or descriptive expressions are attached to services, allowing both the advertisement of services by providers and the formulation of queries about services by users.
We developed a GPAC (Noll et al.

If not   , the photos are searched on the Internet   , first using Flickr and   , if not enough images are collected   , using Google Image.
Node color and symbols match the description from Figures 6, 7 and 8 in the main section of the paper.
The zoom level on the map when the photograph was dragged is recorded   , and the accuracy level of the photo's location information is assigned accordingly.
We are aware that the concept of appeal is highly subjective and difficult to capture.
Unlike neighborhood-based methods   , latent factor models assume that similarity between users and items is simultaneously induced by some hidden lower-dimensional structure in the data.
In order to test and compare different methods   , we remove some edges in the graph and recommend the links based on the pruned graph.
In summary   , we have made the following contributions: i A new type of interaction options based on ontologies to enable scalable interactive query construction   , and a theoretical justification about the effectiveness of these options; ii A scheme to enable efficient generation of top-k structured queries and interaction options    , without the complete knowledge of the query interpretation space; iii An experimental study on Freebase to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach; iv To the best of our knowledge   , this is the first attempt to enable effective keyword-based query construction on such a large scale database as Freebase   , considering that most existing work on database keyword search uses only test sets of small schemas   , such as DBLP   , IMDB   , etc.
It follows the file manager paradigm in which information is presented in hierarchical views.
The data was extracted from a complete snapshot of Flickr from 2008.

We matched these discovered FriendFeed users with a Twitter and Flickr account against the users in the TWD data set and found 131 FriendFeed profiles that listed one of the TWD Twitter accounts with at least 10 public tweets and 5 or more publicly accessible images in their Flickr stream.
To help them in their task   , the assessors were presented the photo   , title   , tags   , owner name   , and the description.
As a result   , Figure 1: Differing Levels of Temporal Association for four tags: sunrise   , sunset   , autumn and leaves.
The relatively short time frame of one week compared to the existence of Flickr guarantees that for all photos   , there was roughly the same chance to obtain community feedback.
Tags provide a simple scheme that helps people organize and manage their data.
Interestingly    , the progressive algorithm Prob-pro did not do as well as expected; its capabilities for early pruning are limited and its queue management   , which required many insert and delete operations   , is a significant cost factor.
On the other hand   , the release of these logs to the greater public would be catastrophic from a privacy perspective.
Results for this set are presented in the extended version of this paper 11.
It checks all tokens if they are present in the thesaurus and substitutes them with their synonyms.

We submit 2 baseline runs and 14 faceted runs.
Hence   , going back to Figure 1   , if we knew that the person issuing the query was an under-25 female user   , perhaps the original order of QAC candidates could be improved by boosting instagram.
Therefore, the revenue decreases to 8.
However, the Stag3 mutants display a leptotene-like stage that has fewer SYCP3 stretches (Fig.
The cell is represented by the distribution of tags associated with its images.
However   , reweighting authors in the Netflix data set did not outperform average   , so it is not clear that there is a simple way to do this.
During evaluation on the 111 questions in the test dataset, we rank all the Java API documents S for each question T in descending order of their ranking score f (T, S).
Finally   , we noticed that many incorrect tuple sets on Art actually had indexing restrictions.

For IMDB 2 , we take all the actors/actresses who have performed in more than 10 movies since 2005 and consider movie locations as their attributes.
This paradigm is in contrast to platforms like Flickr and del.icio.us   , where selecting a tag results in a new search with that tag only.
Traditionally   , query suggestions are presented to users without any information about their potential goodness or quality.
, My Google   , and Google News have attracted much attention due to their potential ability to infer a user's interests from hisher history.
In this paper   , we use SVD as our base algorithm   , since it represents a family of factorization-based methods that work well on the Netflix dataset 4.
This may have biased us towards the experience of negative affect and also contribute to the lack of neural correlates to change in positive affect.
Lastly   , we also conduct a location estimation experiment with our 793 images that were annotated as having been taken inside our ten venues and we create two types of ground truth locations for them: i the Flickr-based ground truth is the location information of each image as provided by the Flickr meta-data   , and ii the corrected ground truth   , i.e.
First   , clustering techniques need to scale to volumes of data behind such social media portals.
They found that such methods perform better for ranking metrics, such as recall and precision 
Evaluation Metrics
 There are several metrics to evaluate recommender algorithms in the literature 
Then we have: 
recall@K = |S purchased ∩ S K,recommended | |S purchased | (13) precision@K = |S purchased ∩ S K,recommended | K (14) 
Conversion rate, a commonly-used metric in e-commerce, is used as an additional evaluation metric in our experiments .

They all achieve the same goal – selecting the text.
In particular   , one new dataset is created from the Wikipedia collection of ClueWeb data.
We also tried classifying the categories of courses and faculty from the WebKB dataset used by Blum and Mitchell 3 and Fürnkranz 9.
We consider a large movie ratings dataset released by Netflix as the basis of a well publicized competition 5.
Flickr provides users with privacy control over photos they upload   , allowing photos to be classified as either private   , visible only to their friends   , or   , the default   , public.
This produces both false positives and false negatives.
Finally, our methods can be expanded to non-televised events.
Stop words are removed in the Twitter and ClueWeb input datasets; additional approximated preprocessing may be applied to reduce sequential time significantly if the trade-off in accuracy is acceptable 13   , 19.
Each page held up to 13 tuples.
The decrease of PP2A methylation observed in brains of AD patients

Although we did not explicitly apply any spam filtering techniques   , the preliminary results suggest that spam is an important issue for experiments based on the ClueWeb collection.
Then the proposed tag refinement method is evaluated within the filtered vocabulary.
We use the mean absolute percentage error MAPE to measure the prediction accuracy:
Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages e.g   , the WebKB benchmark data set   , which contains university web pages   , research papers e.g.
Thus even Sophie initially said of her Photos uploaded to Facebook were often described in different terms than those uploaded to sites such as Flickr as we saw earlier   , or kept on one's own disks.
Furthermore, adding content to the website is simple: textual content is added in the same way as it is added in Wikipedia , taking advantage of an interface that is familiar to millions.

This suggests that the compounds bind to the AF2 site, thereby inhibiting coactivator recruitment.
Similarity computation can be viewed approximately as a Figure 15: Speedup of PSS2 for processing 20M Twitter and 40M Clueweb with varying numbers of cores.
We begin by describing the Flickr data used in our evaluation .
These constraints can he arbitrarily complex, and just stating them adds complexity.
But still they are far from being a comprehensive platform for organizing all types of personal data.
This shows that while the semantic aspect is more important than social aspect for these specific datasets   , the social component helps improving the search result   , in particular for Flickr.
Let us first take a look at the results on the Flickr network.
Besides clustering anomalous behavior   , our model provides interesting insight into the natural clusters of items based on their latent preferences in vj.

In particular   , we studied snow false positives at the operating point at which the likelihood ratio method gives a precision of 74.1% and a recall of 1.2% i.e.
the percentage of links on the Flickr network.
Perhaps because of this   , most systems such as YouTube and Netflix only collect ratings along the preference dimension.
External links on entity pages are split into two parts   , the first external link is a home page   , the other links are usually informational pages.
These are of three types: the Results Summary page, Listmatch pages and Probematch pages.

RDF-based attributes and class names for samples and sequences are then indexed in a document-store database (ElasticSearch, http://www.elastic.co/) for fast retrieval.To submit data to GeOMe (Fig 1), contributors upload a tab-delimited text file together with a Fast Alignment Search Tool-All (FASTA) file (for Sanger sequence data) or a list of Fast Alignment Search Tool-Quality (FASTQ) file names (for high throughput sequence data, in which FASTQ files contain data from an individual sample).
This service is enabled by the index that is created per ARC file.
Currently   , neither Facebook nor Flickr allow group memberships to be private and this is a desirable solution to the problem we have discussed.
In the reciprocal best hit strategy, protein i from genome A is orthologous to protein j from genome B only under the conditions that j is the best hit when i is queried in database B and reciprocally i is also the best hit when j is queried in database A .
It consists of three parts, the typeweight of tag v itself, the average typeweight of all the other tags in M , and the sum of edgeweights of all the edges starting from v and ending at other nodes in M .
We believe that their performance depends on the actual data distribution   , i.e.
We also use the Q V LM for ranking feeds by the negative KL divergence, and get one more faceted ranking.

The photos were taken 2 weeks after the transfer.
This year continues on the last year's main task 1: related entity finding REF   , but includes a few changes.
Our paper contributes to this line of work   , and aims to provide an understanding of how content curation happens   , by collecting a large dataset of > 200K images from Pinterest   , and crucially   , leveraging the category of the pinboards of these images to infer implicit label annotations.
10 different relevance models are constructed   , one from each document in the top 10 results.
However   , before doing so   , we need to ascertain whether those activity features are reliable .
The entire log contains about 530 million requests.
, what people eat in different areas.
For example   , knowing that the user's previous query was guardians of the galaxy can help to inform a QAC system to promote the query imdb in ranking over instagram when the user has just typed i in the search box.
The paper provides an extensive performance evaluation on various real-life   , fairly large datasets: the INEX benchmark   , the IMDB structured movie database   , and the TREC 2004 Terabyte track.
Photo-sharing sites such as Flickr and Panaramio are a great resource for photography enthusiasts and increasingly for travelers.
Standard mechanisms often do not meet this demand.

To evaluate the results   , it is necessary to define the ground-truth region   , which is from Wikimapia with manually annotated regions by amateurs.
Also, when expanding the query, we considered the first 10 term suggestions.
Thus   , we now turn to explore ClustMRF's performance when employed over a document ranking that is already based on using query-independent document measures.
As we can see   , in our experiments on the IMDB dataset Figure 2a   , the average α-NDCG-W for top-1 result of both ranking and diversification on single concept queries was always 0.58   , given any value of α.

This leads to the following well-known greedy algorithm: "seaect as the root a node yielding an optimal balance between the weights of the leftand right-hand subtrees and perform this optimization recursively on both subtrees".
If the disease under consideration is rare (so that genotype frequencies for controls may be expected to be the same as in the general population) then it is intuitively appealing to consider using existing control data from studies of other rare diseases (or population-based studies if they exist) to reduce the cost or increase the statistical power of an association study.
Our study shows that Bidirectional Search outperforms Backward Expanding Search by a large margin across a variety of scenarios.
These users seem to use more colloquial terms than those used in WordNet.
Item recommendation is a harder prediction problem than rating prediction   , as only positive observations are made and standard sparse regression and classification methods like the ones from the Netflix contest can not directly be applied .

Subjects were assigned randomly to condition.
Similarly   , the  netflix  and  movie times  queries   , though not showing a significant effect    , indicate that a preference for domain-contact annotations might exist for at least some navigational and transactional queries.
Datasets: We use the Wikipedia   , Flickr   , Epinions   , and Twitter social graphs.
The extract was incubated with anti-DosR antibodies and run over MagnaBind Protein A coated beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA).
Hence   , there is a great need of automated support for entity-tagging on such social systems; this is the focus of our work.
The baseline performance is among the highest reported in the literature for these setings; for instance Bendersky et al.
Lastly, note that a sufficiently large value of B approximates the first improvement described above.

RESULTS
Of the 2,262 documents judged relevant by our users (R(U)), 1,428 (63%) were also assessed relevant in TREC (we also label it as consistent judgment); while 834 (37%) were assessed irrelevant (NR(T)) in TREC (we also label it as inconsistent judgment) as shown in 
The lack of inconsistency in relevance assessments between our users and TREC assessors stemmed from the following conditions: users who retrieved few documents and judged few relevant documents appeared to relax their criteria for relevance, accepting more documents as relevant contradicting TREC assessments.
Consider the Flickr based semantic space for instance.
We used STATA version 8 for all analyses.
Our example mashup   , called KittenMark   , shows a list of the 20 most recent kitten photos from the Flickr photo sharing site 4 and allows the user to post them to the del.icio.us bookmarks site.
These entries are flagged and saved to a log file, allowing the user to decide whether the taxonomy database needs to be updated to a newer version, or the entries are insignificant and can be added to the automatic exclusion list.
Finally, discussions with our Berkeley friends Mike Stonebraker, Joe Hellerstein, and Mehul Shah helped to improve the presentation.

The Shared References (ShaRef ) 
Design and Architecture
The focus of ShaRef is the collaborative management of reference information.
While we cannot exclude the possibility that Ksg only indirectly alters OppA affinity for PFK in our in vitro assays, the increased apparent KD of OppA for PFK in the presence of Ksg is consistent with competitive binding between Ksg and PFK.The solute binding protein (SBP) of each peptide ABC-importer freely diffuses in the periplasm, binding its substrate and delivering it to the pore of the complex (Fig 6A).
As input to the task, participants were provided with a set of 635 profiles, a set of 50 example suggestions, and a set of 50 geo contexts in CSV/JSON format.
Unfortunately   , Flickr does not provide a record of users who viewed an image.

Another 500-D model with 382k words is learned from user tags of 4 million Flickr images.
Taking this into account, the quality Q of the gig can be defined as a function of the total number of purchases and the corresponding rating of the gig as follows: 
Q(n, r) = 2 1 + e −β log(n+1) − 1 * r 
where n is the number of sales for a seller, r is the rating of the gig and β is used to adjust the shape of the sigmoid function.
Because of the low document-level selectivity of path conditions on IMDB   , the structural constraint tests using range scans on the Elements table to get the prepost codings were much more expensive than for INEX so that random access scheduling became very crucial.
The IMDB experiment faced the particular challenge that the data had very noisy links: on average a movie node was connected to almost 100 other nodes.

With the recent proliferation of Web 2.0 applications such as Del.icio.us 1 and Flickr 2 , tagging services have become popular and have drawn much attention in both academia and industry.
As groups are self-organized   , plenty of groups fall into a similar topic   , i.e.
on behalf of a running query.
We also select only 106 queries which contain at least one relevant Wikipedia document out of the 150 provided queries for training and testing.
Every subscriber to the DSpace developer email list receives notification whenever a page on the Wiki is updated.
Scenario 4.
We found that most users group  similar  or  related  photos into the same set   , and group related sets into the same collection.
We asked colleagues to create 20 meaningful queries with structural and keyword conditions; examples are queries of the kind movieabout.castcastingrole   , Sheriffcastingactorabout.name   , Henry Fonda   , thus looking for movies with Henry Fonda and an arbitrary actor in the role of a sheriff.
All experiments were conducted on the nus-wide dataset 4 containing 269  ,648 Flickr images with visual features   , tags and assigned labels in 81 categories.
It should also be noted that since the QPRP based methods do not require extensive parameter tuning like PT   , the KL and Pearson instantiations of the QPRP are highly competitive   , simple and attractive alternatives.

This requires an additional m d queries.
They were allotted 20 minutes to complete each search.
Traffic volume per hour was calculated by summing the total number of bytes per hour; the number of HTTP requests per hour was calculated by summing the total number of HTTP requests per hour.
As an alternative to stemming we explore digram based vocabulary normalization methods.
We calculated the enrichment of these genes in each slim term relative to the total number of non-essential genes in the slim term that are included in the deletion sets (S7 Fig).
Furthermore, these cells are as thermo-tolerant as their wild-type counterpart (Additional file 6: Figure S4c–e).

We then ran the queries with different configurations of our algorithm and pooled the results .
Sites like Funny or Die blur the distinction further   , as homemade videos vie with professionally-made web series for audiences' attention; in fact   , this blurring is sometimes purposeful   , as amateur videos aspire to be mistaken for professional videos and vice-versa.
They offer two primary arguments.
Similarity graphs of ClueWeb and YMusic are denser and Stage 1 can be too aggressive in making the light partitions absorb too much comparison computation.
Strong generalization results for the Netflix dataset are shown in Table 6.
For IMDB   , propagate performs about 58 times faster   , while for ODP   , it is 82 times faster.
2014    , which contains 3  ,504  ,192 images from 4  ,807 users.
To this end, let us rewrite Eq.
Additionally   , as users tend to annotate Flickr images with a small number of popular tags 11   , there is a lower topic coverage on Flickr in comparison to the vast amount of content and coverage of tweets and users on Twitter.
When a client first visits a site protected by our translator, he accesses an entrance such as the index page.
Where classifiers are used, it is on individual articles.

The film was then exposed for 3 h at room temperature.
We note that using some of the queryindependent document measures utilized here was shown in work on Web retrieval to be effective for ranking documents directly 3 .
A subweb supports structured associative and navigational queries, and unstructured information retrieval and hyperlink following.
Query Results Page Access Pattern
 Let's recall how Web search engine works.
For example   , Netflix can recommend movies similar to those previously viewed by a user   , while Amazon can recommend goods for one based on ratings given by similar users.
One possible explanation for these observations is provided.
Before accessing a new page, a query extends its key range lock to cover all tuples of the page.
Another limitation results from the ranking of resources as implemented by platforms such as YouTube   , Flickr   , and del.icio.us.
This dataset gives ratings about 480  ,189 users and 17  ,770 movies.
They include both fixed effects and random effects, and thus are called mixed effect models.

Our method can be used to bring valuable but unengaged users into the active core of the community by canalizing other people's attention towards them.
Given the large link graph of the ClueWeb collection    , we want to exploit co-citation information to find entities similar to the example entity.
The next major computation is the eigenvalue decomposition required by 8.
Netflix item counts and MovieLens itemedge counts.
In addition it is desirable that a recommender system can be applied flexibly in a wide variety of scenarios.
These objects define what methods can be called on objects of specified classes, but do not implement any methods.Other open bioinformatics projects have intentions and methods that are closely linked with those of Bioconductor.BioJava  provides Dazzle, a servlet framework supporting the Distributed Annotation System specification for sharing sequence data and metadata.
In the case of movie recommendation we have considered movies as nodes in the social network.
The only connection is the set of nuggets associated with each.
We optimized the gene sequence according to the codon frequency table of E. coli BL21(DE3) using the “codon randomization” strategy  and synthesized it.
Therefore the o&ring of tasks becomes relevant.
Flickr asked users who queried  Jerusalem  whether they meant  Israel  or  Occupied Palestinian Territories   ,  but then provided the same data regardless of their selection.
Instead of only links to relevant documents   , these domain specialised sites return answers to user queries.
Though promising   , the network structure exploited in this combined model 9 is a virtual one   , constructed using the same evidence for learning latent factors.

In CoNMF, W is the reduced latent space of items, while H serves as the basis matrix for representing a view.
Therefore   , we test the framework for urban area only.
Runs were generated using a customised version of the Zettair search engine which was adapted to deal with the large scale ClueWeb collection.
Our queries join collections stored in UDB and Notes.
Different types of tagging systems have emerged for different types of content.
Therefore the clustering method ought to be able to cluster up to one thousand snippets in a few seconds.
Once the matrix has been completed that is   , all missing values have been imputed by these neighborhoodbased methods   , a user can be given a recommendation list of ranked items ordered by descending predicted ratings.
These can be used to build web pages that combine the structured ontology information from the ontology with the text from Wikipedia.
The tasks were of two kinds: checking the presence of words and comparing documents.
(6) How useful do you think the interface is to correctly collect bibliographic data of scientific work?
To boost the number of positive i.e.
The 100 top ranked web pages were downloaded   , cleaned of HTML tags and parsed in sentences.
The models are built on the tag sets from public Flickr photos .
The stopping criterion is returning 5 tweets for every query.
Each item belongs to one or more hierarchically organized categories   , and products from the same category define a group which is a  ground truth  community.
A notable exception is the RS_clueweb baseline   , which uses the collections' snippets in combination with the ClueWeb '09 collection to make size estimates.

To answer the five research questions   , we need to derive suitable Flickr and Foursquare activity features.
However   , the two projects rely on a different architecture and very different learning techniques.
, Flickr do not include such information.
Our analysis showed that diurnal patterns in Foursquare (largely, a source of physical-world actions) closely resemble the patterns on Twitter (textual references to actions).
This produces an advantage for LS since its performance is independent of the dataset distribution.
Target sequences and insertion sites are indicated by bold text and arrows, respectively.
Thus   , it addresses both of the challenges mentioned above.
The Flick data set used in this paper contains 150K social relations and 30K rating actions expressed by 5.2K users on 5K items.
Thus   , ERR is more suitable metric for web search.
While weekend and weekday traffic are not significantly different for any of the applications   , all three applications exhibit anthropocentric patterns in their usage over time.

Stage 2 is for anyone who is authorized to view the results.
The reason why higher n-grams and other stylometry methods are less effective is because i the pre-filtering already removes what often links words together   , and ii tweets consist mostly of keywords with fewer stylistic expressions.
By using a Bayesian model with bACCAMS   , we do not overfit the training data and thus can use more stencils for prediction   , greatly improving the prediction accuracy.
CF has been shown to work well across various domains 2   , and many successful web-services such as Netflix   , Amazon   , YouTube and Yahoo!
Plenty of IR techniques that have been tested successfully in general IR on large collections such as clueweb and legal track   , are yet to be evaluated on the medical dataset 4.

There is also the problem of scalability.
There are various ways of aggregating the query term weights, such as averaging them, adding them together, picking the maximum and picking the minimum.
We then computed the micro-averaged precision, recall, and F-measure and rankings for that team, for that resampled corpus.
Adhoc retrieval baseline runs submitted were poor, however, later enhancements provided mediocre results using the BM25 weight function of Okapi.
The score of s is ignored.
The list of contacts for each user is publicly visible in Flickr   , and we used the Flickr API to reduce the necessary bandwidth for crawling.
To identify such sequence elements, we prepared separate alignments of sequences containing a C and those containing a T at the matK editing sites (henceforth called C-elements and T-elements, respectively).
These web crawls have been used at TREC to evaluate ad hoc retrieval and other Web search tasks.
This matrix was hierarchically clustered.We compared our soft clustering approach to additional standard clustering methods (Figure S4a in Additional file 1).

, Netflix   , we have seen more and more APs' direct or indirect contracts with the access and transit ISPs.
The method's performance is comparable to traditional CF algorithms   , even when using an extremely small expert set.
Since user behavior varies over time   , we group pageviews into sessions.
User enforced hierarchies created with tags separated by special characters accounts for a portion of the tag space.
With the training dataset and other sources of tags such as IMDB   , Movie- Lens predicts the relevances for other pairs based on different machine learning models.
In general   , recommendation systems aim to provide personalised recommendations of items to users based on their previous behaviour as well as on other information gathered by item descriptions and user profiles.

This is also why they are looking for providing value-added and differentiated services .
By analyzing these datasets as well as performing in-domain and cross-domain experiments   , we investigate the first question.
The reason we did not do the evaluations on the Netflix dataset is   , it only provides the ratings without any attributes or context information about users or items   , which makes it impossible to perform the context-aware algorithm and the CSEL method by manipulating the attributes Mv proposed in this work.
Extended abstract 
 When users search the web, their goal is to accomplish something , which we call a search task.

For example   , the IMDB Web site does offer a form for searching for movies with multiple specified actors.
Their success comes from their ease of use for collaboratively annotating and sharing information objects   , e.g.
This collects 20 singleterm queries.
CineMatch   , Netflix's recommender   , achieves an RMSE score of 0.9514 on the Netflix dataset   , which is outperformed by MudRecS.
Second, each group submitted retrieval results queried by the topics.
Wikipedia would therefore be usable in modeling our query: We run our queries against the Wikipedia collection   , select the top 10 terms using relevance models from Lavrenko and Croft   , 2001 and mix these with the original query terms.
A new model of cell-cycle regulation.
This yields more than 174k groups spanning the past 12 years since Flickr's launch.

The TREC Terabyte benchmark collection 1 consists of more than 25 million Web pages from the .gov domain   , mostly HTML and PDF files with a total size of about 426 gigabytes.
Probabilities are organized into a tightly interrelated network which in return improves the prediction for each single node e.g.
However   , manually acquiring the labels for these two large scale datasets is expensive and time consuming.
For all three runs we removed results from the ranked lists that have spam ranks smaller than 70% meaning that at most 70% of the ClueWeb have a higher probability of being spam according to the spam rank list provided by the University of Waterloo 4 .
However it requires ranking of the full collection.
We used three publicly available datasets from various real-world online websites: 21   , which originally contains 2  ,588  ,991 users   , 929  ,264 items and 12  ,886  ,488 ratings.
This is expected for nonsynonymous sites, because most polymorphisms will be deleterious and rapidly removed from the population.
We were left with 4.5 million photographs and 28 million tags.
The MPC ranking of matching candidates based on past popularity would be: nascar   , netflix   , nick.com   , nascar.com   , nextel   , northwest airlines and so forth.

However   , we preserve the tag boundaries as defined by the user   , which leads to the following result:
The empirical results in three datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed mixture model with multiple centralized retrieval algorithms.
¯ BIND/DNS: A Domain Name Service (DNS) allows one to retrieve a machine's IP address by presenting the name of the machine.
Besides the convenience of using clusters to group photographs   , our system also provides a tag cloud over each cluster   , which is not included in Flickr.
We then subtract the noise background by definingThe transformation X = (p/q)-1 has the desired effect of subtraction of random background in p and rendering it a stationary time series suitable for subsequent cross-correlation analysis.
The tag universe of the dataset contains 427482 unique tags.
Initially, document expansion was attempted by selecting the top-k TF-IDF weighted terms in a HTML document.

Anyone that has tried one of the many BLAST search tools available in the internet (such as
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi or
http://www.UniProt.org/blast/) knows that the output of a BLAST search is not much helpful for the collection of metabolic data (see Additional file
1: Figure S2 of the supplemental material), because the user has to follow several links to retrieve the data: to retrieve metabolic data, the user has to go over all identified homologue genes, retrieve enzymatic information and compile such information for all genes of the studied genome.
To test this point, we reused the visual search task mentioned in Figure 4 and listed the performances of the two models in Figure 12.
Heretofore   , we studied the performance of ClustMRF when used to re-rank the MRF initial list.

In order to select good wrappers and use them to extract entity names   , we utilize the fact that many websites contain large bers of web pages in the same format e.g.
Several studies investigate image browsing patterns of users.
The performance on the IMDB dataset for these four queries is shown in Figure 11b.
Keyword query interfaces for KVSs must spot the most relevant table to the query and find the most related tuples  in the table.
In other cases we may only have data showing which items were clicked on by a user   , where we assume that a user clicking on an item provides implicit evidence that it is interesting to them for example the Google news recommender system 6.
For example   , flic.kr is used exclusively within the Flickr ecosystem; therefore   , it covers very few categories and exhibits a very low change frequency   , meaning that its short URLs are posted on websites that regard the same subjects   , or even on Flickr directly.
We also consider the implications these findings have on established data sets for the image placing task.

Unsurprisingly   , when names are used in more than one form of metadata   , they are the same names.
In contrast with the anchor text   , link degree is ignorant of the query at hand   , and its main use is in separating the authoritative or important pages from the less popular ones.
, those provided by Wikipedia or IMDB   , and thus there are often millions times millions edges in the graph   , which makes it impossible to materialize and store the matrices and .
We manually inspected a fair number of the results and found that in most cases the results would be considered as good matches by a human user.
This search identified 120 genes with some overlap with the Early-1 search output.
On disk1&2   , .GOV2 and WT10g   , the center of the non-relevant document length distribution shifts far away to the right of the relevant document length distribution .
To illustrate the model in the subsequent sections we use the well-known prototype employee database.
We first describe the dataset used to create the World Explorer visualization.
The script also checked for the presence of a textual evidence string for each gene, although this did not affect the actual score, and the textual evidence provided by many submissions did not exactly match the original abstracts.
We do not use any form of stemming and remove a conservative list of 588 stopwords.
To do that, we assume that the entire set of sentences is broken into U , the useful sentences, and U , the non-useful sentences.
(We used numeric IP addresses to avoid name-server delays; this is one of many examples of trying to reduce all sources of superfluous delays.)
Twitter is both faster and offers wider and denser coverage more users for a given event than Flickr.
From this table we see that   , unlike the results for the MovieLens data   , item-item approach significantly outperforms user-user on both binary and rating NDCG.
Although access and transit ISPs traditionally do not have business relationships with APs explicitly   , with the emergence of video streaming APs   , e.g.

Alice is also very active on the social Web   , having among others a Flickr and a Twitter account which she uses regularly to stay in touch with friends and family.
Twitter visualizations tend to fall into two categories.
Visual materials include digital pictures of people, buildings, events, scenery, and images of scanned documents, photos, writings, and records.
When external links are used to find homepages   , all Wikipedia results without external links to a page in the ClueWeb Category B collection are excluded from the ranking.
This leads to the recent debate of network neutrality 26    , which reflects the ISPs' willingness to provide value-added and differentiated services and potentially charge content providers based on different levels of service quality.
We mined the Bit.ly API to extract the clicks count to that moment t snapshot (i).
INTRODUCTION
When selecting an image to accompany a document, graphic artists/illustrators will usually follow three basic steps: (a) select the image based on content (i.e., semantic relevance to the article); (b) image quality; (c) document's layout 
USER STUDIES

Our observations show that the percentage of social actions ϕ over the total number of actions denoted by |At| remains fairly constant throughout the evolution of SRN for both Epinions and Flickr.
The dataset was obtained from the IMDB Website.
However   , an initial analysis showed that many of them had very few ratings and were therefore not adding any improvement to our predictions see per user distribution in the experts data set in Figure 2b.
This will allow participants to study problems such as different weightings of interactions from different users.
We use precision
Second   , we present four different tag recommendation strategies to support to the user when annotating photos by tapping into the collective knowledge of the Flickr community as a whole.

In a high dimensional feature space, this assumption is valid.
On the one hand   , more and more Web resources become available in popular folksonomy or social tagging mechanism based systems   , such as Flickr 1    , YouTube 2 and del.icio.us 3 .
In the end   , we constructed 100 information sources for the testbed ClueWeb-Wiki   , with statistics provided in Table 2.
We selected and adapted the gradient boosting machine GBM algorithm 24   , in part because of its suitability for learning problems where only a small fraction of features examined are informative 25   , and because of the ability to perform stochastic sampling of training examples   , which is well suited to the problem of finding the most likely genes explaining the association signal at GWA loci.
2 ClueWeb dataset containing about 40 million web pages   , randomly selected from the ClueWeb collection 5 .
On the one hand   , user generated content constitutes a large fraction of the high-quality   , easily accessible content that makes the Web useful.
The table lists the following statistics each for the whole batch of queries: the parameter k   , the amount of queries   , the sum of sorted accesses and the sum of random accesses for the entire batch   , the per-query average process CPU times in seconds   , the sum of queue operations inserts   , deletes   , and updates for TopX   , the maximum number of cached items for the hash-structure used in numbers of documents   , the macro-averaged precision at k P@k and the mean average precision MAP for the top-k using official relevance assessments for INEX and Terabyte.

ANSWERING SINGLE ENTITY QUERY
We introduce Entity Profile (EP) to answer single entity queries and EP is built by first obtaining Web pages W using Entity E as the query term from a Web search engine (our experiments use Google), then reducing noise from obtained Web pages (This involves HTML comments, JavaScript code, tags removal and traditional IR based preprocessing steps such as stopwords removal), then identifying a relevant set of passages (our experiments use sentences) from the cleaned documents and then identifying characteristic terms from these passages and assessing their relative importance as descriptors of entity E. We assume the most useful information is typically centered around the entity and use windowing (e.g.

The demand for more expressive mechanisms is reflected in the richness of preferences offered by web applications as diverse as matchmaking sites   , sites like Amazon and NetFlix   , and services like Google's AdSense.
The average tag co-occurrence on other Flickr images is deemed as one domain   , and their content correlation as another domain .
We list some of the important ones below.
For example, science blogs allow a more detailed discussion of an article as compared to comments or tweets, and journals themselves sometimes choose to highlight a paper on their own blogs, allowing for a more digestible explanation of the science for the non-expert reader .

BACKGROUND
The Flickr Feasibility Study (FFS) is an experimental service developed by the IMLS Digital Collections and Content (DCC) project to facilitate participation by cultural heritage institutions in Web 2.0 spaces such as Flickr.
We assumed that one pollen grain contains 500 pg of total RNA.
For each of the crawled shows, we collected the names of actors and their respective characters.
In this Section   , we evaluate our approach on social images that are collected from Flickr.

Most state-of-the-art recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation tech- niques 1   , which either learn users' preferences from their ratings or identify user's interests based on item descriptions and historical data.
We used an entity reference table containing 2.04 million person names and their synonyms 4  obtained from IMDB   , Wikipedia   , DBLP   , ACM as well as several internal databases.
This creates one dataset of 48  ,090 users and 17  ,770 movies   , which we will refer to as Netflix-48k   , and one dataset of 24  ,047 users and 17  ,770 movies   , which we will refer to as Netflix-24k.
This study shows that the proposed WE- MAREC method outperforms all the other six matrix approximation based CF methods on both the datasets.
The complete DBLP database has about 300  ,000 authors and 500  ,000 papers resulting in about 2 million nodes and 9 million edges.

We first filtered out the users who have no contacts in Flickr site or in our user set.
Our approach can be considered complementary to the above systems   , in the sense that not only do we provide a methodology to define ontologies enriched with thesaurus hierarchies   , but also the choice of RDF as the representation language enables their exchange in a machine readable format.
The spread of social media sharing sites like Flickr has made the study of social networks increasingly tractable from a computer science point of view Backstrom et al.
In the example below , a 'column' is retrieved as a DB2Xml object.
We evaluate the system using the ImageNet collection of 14 million images 2.
How can larger grained semantics be embedded in web data?
Social networks have attracted much attention these days.
This can be interpreted by the high average user contribution in these two data sets   , where our methods inflict more data loss by limiting individual data in the sampled database.
The HEP database links to the Ensembl genome browser, providing additional information about the region of interest.
We use a sample of nearly 150 million geo-tagged   , timestamped Flickr photos as our source of user-contributed observational data about the world.

Following tradition, we construct a relational-like algebra by defining analogs for each relational operators (n u, -7 x, 6, ?T, and W) that take sandbags as arguments and produce a sandbag as a result.
Coworking spaces, makerspaces, hackerspaces, startup incubators, and entrepreneurship hubs are usually open to listening to new projects.
Consequently, we implement the following AB metrics.
Another possible explanation is that the class had a very skewed distribution which persisted in friendship circles.
For San Francisco   , at 1% FPR   , we have 60% TPR to match Flickr and Twitter accounts and 42% TPR for Yelp to Twitter.
Second   , we repeatedly generated wrappers on randomly selected websites in our set excluding BN and Art   , of course   , and also excluding IMDb which as mentioned had a very different extraction scenario than the others   , and measured how the ranking of the desired tuple sets for BN and Art was impacted by having first trained the system on these other sites.

Recent advances in automatic entity linking and knowledge base construction have resulted in entity annotations for document and query collections.
We experimented expansions with Wikipedia, Google and both.
Section 6 provides a detailed overview of the facet ranking process.
To convert the annotations to binary judgments   , we treated the documents with average ratings among annotators of less than 2.5 as controversial   , and otherwise non-controversial.
A typical query like  Genre ⊇ {Western} ∧ Actor ⊇ {John Wayne   , Katherine Hepburn} ∧ Description ⊇ {sheriff   , marshall}  required 10802 sorted accesses for both Prob-con and Prob-smart with run-times 0.41 and 0.51 seconds   , whereas TA-sorted performed 26402 accesses in time 4.92 seconds for k=20   , both at precision 0.7.
leads to a substantial delay and high content locality in information propagation.
Therefore there are 98.81% of elements are missing in the rating matrix.

This approach is unsafe if the Flickr web service is not trusted   , because it allows Flickr to observe or hijack the user's KittenMark session.
Our system scanned through the whole Wikipedia repository the version that is included in the ClueWeb collection and computed the following normalized vectors for each document: Words-occurrences frequencies; we assigned a threshold value to exclude all low frequency terms and to keep the ones with frequency higher than the threshold.
For each of the detectable objects   , the Flickr classifiers output a confidence score corresponding to the probability that the object is represented in the image.
A vocabulary trainer could automatically enrich the words to be learned by retrieving pictures from Flickr or videos from YouTube.
Although many of such compounds bear bonds that are rare or non-existing in the natural realm, it is not infrequent to isolate bacteria able to use them as C, N and/or energy sources, especially in places with a history of chemical pollution –.

3 We validate the theoretical results with an empirical study   , by simulating the setting of the problem using the Netflix dataset and comparing the effectiveness of our algorithms to that of several baselines.
In addition, the presentation performance is generally less reliable.
For example   , over a three-month period of time at eBay   , each buyer on average made 17.31 bids and won 5.63 of them.
We first report scalability results on Flickr see Figure 5b.
This is based on an intuitive assumption that if two users have neighbor relationships like friends, they are tend to be more similar than others.
Note that since ratings in Flickr have binary values   , rating adoption influence is not applicable to Flickr.
User evaluations then can be used to validate their retrieval effectiveness.
Data Collection For our experiments we collect an image dataset from Flickr 4 consisting of 2M images.
Using this evaluation technique   , we empirically illustrate the benefits of our approach and estimate a CTR lift of up to 3x in Xbox's main dash and up to 2.7x in Xbox's recommendations dash.

That is, for each di we store a list of integers obtained from the digest of the terms contained within.
Given the novelty and initial success of the method   , we believe that domain-specific variants of ACCAMS   , such as for community detection and topic modeling   , can and will lead to new models and improved results.
The rest of the paper uses location information derived from the user profile, as described next.
Users who responded that their age was less than 18 years during the demographic questionnaire (i.e., minors) were excluded from the study: the app allowed these users to play the games, but no data were submitted to the server (hence the minimum age category on Fig 7C is 18–25 years).The information-seeking game was available by clicking on “Am I a risk-taker?”, which launched the game.
In step 1, similarity between users is computed using Pearson correlation coefficient, defined by

We use the Flickr API as the underlying search provider for our NicePic!
They build a topic network based on Flickr tags   , and propose an interactive interface that allows the user to express a query by selecting images.
The result of this is that the way the content is consumed is strongly influenced by all of the different social navigation paths that lead to it: a photo on Flickr   , for example   , can be linked to from a user's favorite photo collection   , from several groups   , galleries   , and via other mechanisms   , including the  external  web i.e.
The objective evaluation was conducted according to the contacts function in Flickr site   , which is organized by users themselves.
In our work 18 on crowdsourcing competitions we also noticed a tendency of some workers to cooperate in order to achieve a competitive advantage manifesting in attempts to share accounts   , which we had to prevent at that time due to our experimental design.

While it remains appropriate for the sample sizes used in current studies (e.g., dozens to hundreds of individuals), or even larger with the support of a moderate-sized computing cluster (because MACAU is easily parallelizable with respect to sites), rapid increases in sample size—especially in the context of EWAS—strongly motivate additional algorithm development to scale up the binomial mixed model for data sets that include thousands or tens of thousands of individuals.
This is very consistent with WebKB and RCV1 results .
We collect the human provided annotations as meta-data to improve future search by keywords.
Despite these two aspects   , we use similar concepts to analyse the tag relations.
In addition to explicit friends defined by the user (which rarely happens in Flickr), we also considered two users as friends if one of them commented a picture uploaded by the other.
At the end of the challenge organizers released all the challenge data including test data into public domain.
This type of failure is indicative of a poor user experience   , often due to packet loss 22.

Brief Discussion
 The results indicate that our idea of training axiom combinations based on the user clicks did not improve the ranking very much.
We currently investigating the provision of short training videos to develop guidelines for library implementers.
, d t 100 }).
These differences might be due to the limited number of topics available for the TREC 678 collection 20 in total   , but also because of the different kind of documents in these collections newswire articles vs. First of all we note that the KL based QPRP model performs the best on each collection when surrogates are used in the TREC 678 and pairwise comparisons are used on ClueWeb.
Therefore, instead of optimizing the likelihood, we choose to optimize the information entropy .
We see sparse activity within every group of photos – for example   , Flickr does not contain photos tagged Golden Gate Bridge for every day since January 1   , 2004.
The expression {DEMO field2 = "ABC" fieldl = 1} would build a simi-lar object.

CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we examined the effectiveness of viewer comments for the music mood classification.
Note how the term o~feoporosis has relatively more weight in the structured queries.
Like many other social media sites   , Flickr also allows users to designate others as  friends  or  contacts  and offers an interface to see in one place the latest images submitted by these friends.
White bars in the right-hand panels indicate minimal myofibrillar bundle width on each fiber.
Finally   , to collect evidence of information flow over a social network    , we collected information on the favorite photos of the Flickr users.

In many experimental settings   , the new approaches can successfully improve result diversification over traditional approaches that only consider document relevance.
A lot of user-resource pairs on Twitter 90% have only one edge between them x = 1   , while those on Flickr and Delicious are less 10%   , which is also shown by the plateaus on Flickr and Delicious.
After presenting structural properties   , we describe various popularity metrics that could be used for pictures in Flickr   , and discuss why we chose to focus on the number of fans.
Such concepts can be derived from crowd intelligence folksonomies such as Wikipedia   , cotagging in Flickr   , or from online bookmarking services such as del.icio.us.
A message is linked only to its children and its parent   , and there are no relationships between two different threads   , or among messages belonging to different threads.
Elusive information need As the user realizes new relevant contents in top-ranked documents, he internally refines the definition of " relevance " and reformulates the query.
In our experiments   , we use the del.icio.us tags provided by Peter Mika   , which were also used in Mika   , 2005   , and Flickr tags for photos posted between 01-02-2004 and 01-03-2006.

All or a portion of the TM and CT cysteine residues were substituted with either serine or alanine to produce SDV rHA proteins.
For the Wikipedia dataset based on ClueWeb   , the proposed model also consistently outperforms SFI and LR.
In addition to visual features   , the textual annotation of images available in Web 2.0 folksonomies such as Flickr can provide additional clues on the attractiveness of photos.
For the query sistine chapel without any geographic restrictions   , Flickr returns nearly 30   , 000 images.
Because the annotation only specifies the interacted protein ID in the article without the passages providing evidence or the location of these molecules, it makes the training process untraceable and the process of error analysis extremely difficult.
It uses these sources to extract structured information   , e.g.
Therefore   , the social group suggestion task is converted to as a classification problem.

Fürnkranz also reported a significant improvement in classification accuracy when using the link-based method as opposed to the full-text alone 7  on 1  ,050 pages of the WebKB corpus 2    , although adding the entire text of  neighbor documents  seemed to harm the ability to classify pages 3.
Since users in the Random sets have smaller social networks   , they get more exposure by posting images to groups.
For the extreme categorizers we used the photoset feature from Flickr   , where users sort their pictures into albums   , just like users would organize their pictures in folders on their hard drives 1  ,419 users with 39  ,298 tags.
To be able to cope with imbalanced data   , we modified the logistic loss function in the mutli-task learning methods by adding an instance weighting matrix to its formulation.
This approach builds on existing work that demonstrate that free-form text can exhibit characteristics sufficiently unique to identify an author 15.

Before computing the R-value, the gene-expression values were centered on the centroid mean of the comparison groups of interest.
Coalescent statistics for the neutral case are in line with these expectations (Table 1 Figure 3).
Another example of a use case for a web-based front-end is searching for services and their tags.
incomplete lineage sorting e.g.
For the Gov and Imdb settings Prob-con temporarily even created a larger queue than the TA-sorted baseline using periodic garbage collection   , but Prob-con dropped this large queue quickly after initialization and then distributed the remaining candidate items to multiple small queues.
The way we calculate V depends on the community   , for example for IMDB movies we compute the average star rating as shown in the example of Figure 1A   , while for videos we take the ratio of likes over the sum of likes and dislikes.
So I missed the 5:00, the 5:30 news, and I wasn't listening to the anchor.

For each segment, using the same amount of space as the original ciphertext (s blocks), we pre-compute and store s modular multiplications of uniformly random subsets of the s blocks (i.e., s product values out of the values in total).
To perform our analysis   , we split the activity of a single user into different sessions when either of these two conditions hold:  External url: if a user visiting Flickr leaves the site and returns from a different domain   , the current session ends even if previous visits are within the 25 minute threshold we make the assumption that if a user is viewing a page on Flickr and visits another domain   , then the session ends.
So the fire station receives both written and verbal notification .

Discussion
To further understand the user behavior data and our proposed algorithm, we consider two simple algorithms that also use user behavior data or user browsing graphs: PageRank-UBG (weighted PageRank computed on the user browsing graph), and Naive BrowseRank (product of the number of clicks and average observed staying time).
Flickr allows users to group their photos in album-like folders   , called sets.
Fluorescently labeled TBC-8 showed a cytosolic localization with some punctate membrane staining (Figure 5A) reminiscent of RAB-2.

Glucose metabolism starts with glycolysis, which produces pyruvate.
Furthermore, we propose a new scheme (defined by Equation 5 ) to diminish the divergence between the training data and the test data.
Filtering out anonymous reviews did not have a significant effect either positively or negatively   , but filtering out non-prolific authors removed a large amount of data in the merchant reviews   , making the model unable to score many pairs in the test set as an object was not rated at all in the filtered training data 5 .
This metric gauges the ability of each model to replicate the human aesthetic preferences on non-popular Flickr images.

In the KBS system   , we chose to directly integrate the categories as special nodes in the graph.
For the IMDB dataset   , the set-cover heuristic produces solutions that dominate the LLT heuristic in terms of coordination cost and load.
Again   , FullModel is clearly the closest to the real data set in both Flickr and Epinions.
First, we describe the application science.
PageRank calculation was parallelized over 64 cores using Hadoop.
To broaden the search, the “related articles” function provided in PubMed was also used, and all articles and citations obtained were reviewed.

We then textually parsed our geo-referenced items which are tags in Flickr   , hashtags and captions in Instagram   , and tweets in Twitter and searched for exact matches with the dictionary words.
Title queries are used for retrieval.
The wisdom of the few approach is less sensitive to scale   , as it creates recommendations from a very reduced set of experts e.g.
This is similar to what is described in an Internet Movie Database IMDb record.
A more detailed description of the dataset and its collection procedure can be found in 6.
The relatively even workload benefits the task load balancing process and reduces parallel execution time by 5% to 18% additionally.

Annotating Event Images: Photographs taken at social and world events present an interesting challenge for annotation models as there exists much evidence from many disparate sources i.e.
Furthermore    , while no significance can be calculated for the improvements on TREC 678 due to the number of topics   , improvements over PRP and PT obtained on ClueWeb are statistically significant.
The Pearson based QPRP consistently provides excellent retrieval performance regardless of the comparison method -and while this is not always better than the optimised PT   , it is not significantly worse   , and in form the surrogate.
Its underlying information system is a big le system 1 that serves HTML pages.

Note that indeed   , U i changes for every movie i   , as the actual available ratings differ from one movie to another in the Netflix dataset.
The low correlation between the number of view and fans could indicate that users find many of the pictures they view uninteresting.
Concluding remarks
The back-end
The back-end actually accomplishes the debugging.
These observations demonstrate that information does not propagate widely in the Flickr social network.
Using conventional keyword retrieval models   , we retrieve an initial distribution over documents D ∼ φ ir Q   , D. Alternatively   , we can derive indicators for relevant entities through a pseudo-relevance feedback approach on entity links in ClueWeb documents.
The situation is further complicated by the emergence of new players in the ecosystem: Content Delivery Networks CDNs   , e.g.
For the IMDB collection   , we generated an XML document for each of the movies available at the Internet Movie Database www.imdb.com.
Specifically   , * Nathan and Tye are also affiliated with UC Berkeley.
Without loss of generality   , we take the most popular photo sharing site   , Flickr   , as the social media platform to illustrate our multi-level graph modeling   , which mainly has four types of entities   , i.e.
KOALA was restricted to the Mediothek inventory   , but used the up-to-date data   , which slightly differed from our copy used in MedioVis.
In contrast, on ClueWeb B, it provides an MAP that is as high as 0.6340, which is 173% higher than the BM25 baseline, even if its parameter b is optimized.

To keep track of the status of these questions, the analyst keeps semi-structured auxiliary notes that do not document the requirements so much as the process of elaborating them.
(c) Same data as in panel b but with a magnified y-axis.Given the poor performance of the standard t test in ranking differentially expressed genes (Figure 2), it is perhaps not surprising that the P values generated by the standard t test fall so far from uniform.
Faceted topics have a well-defined focus.
Finally   , we conjecture that such process could be executed at indexing time   , thus eliminating any additional on-line costs.
We use one real-life and one synthetic data set in our evaluation.
From their results   , anchortext words alone were slightly less powerful than the full-text alone   , and the combination was better.
In the case of NetFlix 22   , anonymized user ratings were combined with IMDb ratings to infer individuals.

This number appears to be sufficient for effectively ranking photos at the city scale.
Use of the -O3 and -funroll-loops for compiler optimization also significantly increases its running speed; for a small dataset we tested, this speedup can be more than two fold.
Then the transfected cells were subjected to standard ChIP protocol in Pierce Agarose ChIP Kit (Thermo Scientific, NH, USA).
To k eep our demonstration focused   , we will show h o w to build a wrapper for the the Internet Movie Database IMDb and create a gateway to serve these HTML pages as XML documents.
This procedure collapsed the 275 MEG sensor data to two source wave forms representing the activity of the sources in the left and right hemisphere derived for all responses to deviant and to standard tones.
On the other side   , ReDDE.top is more sensitive to noise in such an environment   , as a notso-relevant sample document from a really big source may result in too much bias in favor of that source and affects the final ranked list.

For example, the book mashup 1 and DBPedia 2 connect various sets of semantic data.
Similarly, it is possible to load the customer ID of Amazon users.
Thus the time to process a single topic with a configured corpus size of 16 was about 2 minutes without any parallelization.
Training: For each of the 272 concepts   , we randomly selected about 650 images and obtained 180  ,000 images in total from ImageNet as the training data in the source domain.
Our preliminary results did not show much improvement , and we are currently analyzing them carefully.
On the other hand   , our methods SRA and HPA greatly outperform existing approaches and HPA even achieves 100% precision for Netflix data.
We note   , however   , that due to differences between our system's retrieved results and the contents of the ClueWeb collection   , these results can only be considered an estimate.
Thus the two learning algorithms perform similarly.
We will use the following notation for such a queryrule in this paper:  However   , we still have not solved the problem about incomplete information here since the atom ratedbad@http:www.moviereviews.com again depends on an open rule; i.e.
Several benchmark collections were used in the study to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed term weighting methods for text clustering.

For each movie we also know the language and the country where it was produced.
One of the three classifiers textual   , visual   , or textual+visual is selected for each image based on the availability of the image features.
Our current project analyzes social media data metrics instead.
Thus the main idea is to use the behavior history from other like-minded users to provide the current user with good recommendations.
Users of websites like MySpace    , Flickr   , and Facebook create networks of friends.
We demonstrated the merits of using such measures for ranking document clusters.
We queried it and the 100 top ranked web pages were then extracted from the Warc files   , cleaned of HTML and parsed in sentences too.
This resulted in a statistically significant performance decrease with respect to at least one of the three evaluation metrics of concern MAP   , p@5 and NDCG@5 for all top-10 feature functions for the ClueWeb settings.
It is hence important to study the correlations between social friendships and user interest similarities.
Using the Lemur Toolkit 4.10 we indexed these collections   , where stemming was applied and stop words removed.

Note that in this example, if T2 represents a Flickr image post, and t3 the automated Tweet for the image post, then T2 − t3 represents the delay resulting from desynchronized clocks between Flickr and Twitter.
For instance   , Koren 19  investigated methods to model the underlying temporal dynamics in Netflix data with encouraging results.
2008, 4 = Sanna et al.
We use the following labels: 1 Animals   , 2 Birds   , 3 Architecture    , 4 Portrait   , and 5 Nature.
This extensibility is achieved in Tycoon by adding a set: ond type parameter D to the thread signature.
Second   , we are interested in developing tools and features in Flickr that can enable the full viral spread that the theory suggests is possible.
Computing 5K recommendations for the Twitter   , Flickr and Epinions datasets took 40913   , 2169 and 1581 seconds   , respectively    , under the U N I propagation model.
Works are the most abstract level and contain information about movies or programs as intellectual or artistic creations.
MyTag 4 partially overcomes this limitation by providing a single interface to retrieve combined results from Flickr   , YouTube   , and del.icio.us.
Among them, the former two kinds are considered to be effective in open networks.
Similarly, the formats of songs are restricted to MIDI data.
In the example of 
(5) 
Similarly, we refine Condition 4.
This query involves the Countries and Cities collections managed by the relational wrapper, and the Hot e 1 s collection managed by the web wrapper.
Without a page view trace or asking the user directly   , we cannot say for sure how users in Flickr found photos.
We model the problem of predicting user retention in reference to the StumbleUpon ecosystem.
Spalding proposes an informal  cocktail party  test where two books belong to the same work if two people casually talking about them think they are discussing the same thing even if they read the book in different languages or editions 6.
Hence   , tag recommendation method suitable for photos in Flickr or other online resources may not be directly applicable for hashtag recommendation for tweets.
Without reliable measures of night activity on Flickr   , of the presence of specific Foursquare places   , and of the presence of Flickr photo tags   , we cannot test our hypotheses.
We provide biochemical evidence that nuclear Ago1, but not Ago2, directly associates with RNAP II.
In EpiExplorer, we achieve the necessary runtime performance by using the CompleteSearch engine , which has originally been developed for semi-structured text search in large document repositories.
Additionally   , we experiment with a pre-trained model with 3m words 8   , trained on a Google News dataset.
5b, c).
We used the MIR Flickr-2008 test set 9  for the experiments .
Moreover   , we need to get the word out that data scientists work in many fields—from determining the best content to deliver for Netflix   , to helping the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention track flu epidemics   , to helping retailers determine how to market to customers.
When the user launches the CBIR facility   , a content-based search engine PIRIA is employed.
1 We analyzed the data to answer three key questions: 1.
found, as well as other authors such as Malvankar et al.

This approach is denoted as LR-DivS   , as it applies logistic regression within the diversification approach based on source-level estimation.
This portion consumes the data file and renders the tags on the screen   , along with some sample photos for the tags   , taken from the Flickr website.
Activation by odor results in a sparse pattern of activity in the olfactory bulb –.
Although the MediaEval benchmark also provides a test set a set of Flickr items for which to estimate their latitudelongitude    , we created our own for two reasons:  It is very difficult to determine for arbitrary Flickr users whether they have a Twitter account unless they provide it in their Flickr user profile.
As described above   , we train the Caffe library 18 using 1.3 million images annotated with 1000 ImageNet classes 6 and apply it to classify Pinterest images.
Exportin 5 binds to pre-60S particles isolated on two different TAP-tagged pre-60S-associated trans-acting factors.
We conclude and show directions of our future work in Section 6.
The same correlation holds for median age.
We summarize related work in Section 8 and conclude in Section 9.
